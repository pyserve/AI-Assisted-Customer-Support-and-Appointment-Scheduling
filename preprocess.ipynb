       "\" Hello, my speaking, am I speaking with Ms. Manoharun? Yes, speaking. My name is Brandon calling from Viva Rika home. I'm calling you to do a quality check after your installation that we have done back in January. Please note that this call is being recorded for training and quality assurance purposes. I'm to confirm that you're the home owner of 3, 7 long meadow road, Brampton, correct? Yes. Did the technician clean up after the installation? Yes, they did. Did the technician explain how the product works? Yes. Okay, ma'am. And how would you rate out the technician on the scale of 1 to 5? Yes, he was okay. I think it may be 405. Thank you for your positive feedback, ma'am. I will send you a link in a minute so that you can post your review for him on our Google page. And should you have any further questions or concerns? Please do not hesitate to contact us. toll free at 1 800 448 7214. Okay. One more thing before I leave, I mean, let you go because the thing is that when they were offering this product, they were saying it's energy efficient and it would reduce the heating and cooling cost by 40%. But our electricity bill increased actually. Oh. So when I called the high-for company, they were asking, oh, did you install a heat pump? Then I said, yes, or that's the reason. So what's the feeling? So, ma'am, you can call back at 1 800 448 7214. And I mean, when you call, so they will take each and everything on the nodes and they will send you to the management team and they will do something about it. Okay, ma'am. What's something? Ma'am, they will do something about it like why it is increased the bills, each and everything like they said it is efficient. So they will do something about the bills. Something about the bill, but this is high-for bill, right? Yes, ma'am. Your hydrophilic, like you said, it is increasing, right? Yes. It's quite a bit increased. It's about more than 80, 90% increased. Oh. No, ma'am. You just write down the number. 1 800. 448. It says we work, go home number. Yes, yes. 1 800 448 7214. Okay.
