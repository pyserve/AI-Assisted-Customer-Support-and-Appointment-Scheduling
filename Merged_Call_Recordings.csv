Like, uh, I'm, Alex, I didn't pay anything to them. They add automatically on my bill. Do they don't pay anything to audit guy? No, they, they, they are the after. Yeah, yeah, the audit is fine.

But I believe you might have to pay her first, have the invoice and then they will give you guys the money. For the, for the buyout for the buyout. Yes. Yeah, yeah. The buyout, buyout actually, you know what, like when they send us bill. So it is take time to get the bill to us because we need to be canceled with them.

Your brother told me to give you a call and are you able to add him? I am here. I'm here, we need him. Oh, you're here already? Okay, perfect. How's it going guys? I'm good. Thank you. Awesome. So, Amit, tell me. What's the case in your house? What were you looking to change? All the things that my brother did that. Okay, so the hip-hop is the number one. So, thank you. I'm, I'm a thank you. Thank you. That's what I would. You see this? He mentioned that you have a tank right now. Yes. And you want to go tankless. Yes. Yeah. Actually, but I like you tell him with the thank you, not going to be 0% you tell him everything. what the tankless unit will explain in the first. Yeah, so the tankless, the tankless essentially is no part of the zero percent loan. So what we can do for the tankless is we still can offer you the option for the financing at 0.99%. Because the other thing that you could take advantage of the tank of the zero percent is the government has approved a heat pump water tank. What are you gonna be another tank? But it's a lot more efficient than a gas or electric water tank. So it's never gonna be able to give you more savings. The only difference is that you're still gonna get a tank in return, but it's a heat pump water tank. And it does qualify for the loan. Me personally, I would recommend you to do that just because you don't have to pay interest on it. And it's still more efficient than a tankless. But the problem is this, I don't, there is a basement with my house is a smaller house. I've come to my house, the Bazaar house. My house is at 2443, clear feet. Yeah. I meet there, we renovate the basement and I meet the space for the basement because the tank left like a tank is covering all the space. So that's why you were thinking of doing tankless, right? That's correct. I mean, we can see what the tankless, the only difference it would be that you would just pay 7.99 per cent on interest rate on it. How much how much of you pay on gas right now? I have no good position. Is your is your tank that you have right now gas or electric? Like gas. If gas, right? Okay. Yes. And then he mentioned something also about the bio. Yes, yes. How long have you been with them? 2018. So that's only six years, right? That's correct. Yes. That's correct. And besides that tank, do you have any, is that with reliance? The reliance? No. In a car. Do you have any idea how much it is? Ventil? How much have you been right now in rental? I believe it was 4,000 something. It's $2,000. No, no, no, the bio bio didn't 4,000 I believe. It's 100 something. I left you here. Yeah, I'm right here. What I'm going to what I'm probably going to have to do is I'm going to have to send you the. Pretty much the sheet for the bio for the contract for any care. So you can fill it and then back to us and we can call them and see if we can negotiate something on your behalf. But for now, so we're looking at a 2500 score footage home up to. We have a heat pump. We have a tank list. See what the bio option is. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to build up a quote that I'm going to be. Can I get your email? You can start with my brother too, but I'm going to give you my email address as well. And I can do both. I can do both for sure. Yeah, mix. So I'm. Yeah, each. And a D. Yeah. Dot S. Dot. And my. Yeah. A quote. Okay, so I'm going to send you and send your brother abmed. How about that come. And how many showers is in your home? I'm going to send you a quote. I'm going to send you a quote. Right now, three. And supposed to be. It's going to be four. Hmm. The basement. It's right now three. You probably going to be four. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is. I'm going to build up the agreement. Not agreement. Like just like a quote. I'll forward you both. And show you what the option for the financial side is. Is that home your primary home? Yes. And are you the owner of it? Yes. Perfect. So the for the out of it, it will be the same thing for the zero percent loan. It will be the sum and similar. We were going to add the cost of the out of it as well to it the $750. So what I'm going to do right now, Mirza, is I'm going to put everything together. And forward to both of you guys. So you could see it. I'm going to see what my colleague, what my supervisor says about the bio and get back to you on that. Okay. No problem. Give me about 20 minutes and you should receive that. And I'm going to give you a call back for confirmation that we were we were able to do it or not. Okay. Yeah, Alex, please. I have about six. My family member, real family member, we need to do the same thing what we've done for myself. Six of them. Yeah, I'm two to one. This one, one my wise house, which one I tell you and two my sister house. Four house. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. And I will tell you. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. And how much is the heat pump for my brother house? How much is my mind is bigger and he's smell. Right? For his is three tonne for his will be 52 to 50. So it's about almost $300 less. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Give me one. Thank you. Give me one sec. Bye bye. I'll be back to you guys. Bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye.

So I just wanted to give you the the price you were asking for the daykin. Yeah. So let me just pull it up because they got back to me here. So we were looking at, I'm just trying to pull up the original email that I sent for the good the Goodman, rather a three-head system, which is 36,000 BTU or if we switch it over to the two-head system, still 36,000, it's the same unit. Right. So that one was 11, 250 plus HSP. The daykin. Sorry. Yep, go ahead, sorry. Oh, sorry. Okay, sorry. You cut out there. So yeah, so the daykin won the original price, I'm actually that they gave me was 12.8. So that's the price difference, but I can bring it down if you were looking to pay it up front. Still go with the incentive program, but pay it up front because that's the invoice that needs to be submitted. I can bring it down to 12 even. Okay, and that's install on everything, right? That's install warranty of the all-in. Yeah. Okay. Would you be able to send me the information? Yep, sure. So what on I do this because we have been going back and forth quite a bit, and I know you know you're still trying to figure out exactly what you guys want. Do you want it's Friday now? Do you want the weekend to review it and then Monday we can make kind of a final decision because I am also like that discount is kind of coming from me as well. Yeah, management told me 12.8, but you know I'm trying to help you out because we've been going back and forth. Yeah. So do you want to do that or what are you comfortable with I guess? I do have another quote coming in on Monday, so I would prefer a little bit longer, but I mean it's just yeah tough. It's a cool client one, right? Oh yeah, this one is like it's a high like super high efficiency. Okay. And then we could secure you in. Like I mean you're you're in around the right price, so I don't want to say like Monday. Like I don't know I don't know about Monday, but I want to look at the unit. I want to see you know how about we do take the weekend Monday like let's say later in the day, you know I can hold that promotion because I have to let management know that I'm giving that extra discount as well. And then the other thing is we could you know we could go ahead at least to secure in the application for you. So if anything happens and secure an attentive date for the audit, if that's the route you still want to take. Yeah. Is that fair? Yeah. And so Monday if I reach over to like any time after 3 or 4 o'clock or what's your preference? Yeah that's fine. 4 o'clock would be nice. Around 4 o'clock? More time yeah. I've ever been incentive. You said that. What are the rules on that again? Like what can I think are wrong with down here? Let's see. So you have to get the audit done by a licensed auditor three, their embridge or the candidate greeners, which all of the auditors we work with are on the list and approved because not all auditors qualify. Some people don't know that, but so you have to get your audit done. So both audits 700 cover your pre and your post audit. The government funds up to you as well of course. So that's the first thing that we would do is secure in the audit because it is a first come first serve with them and then we would secure in your application of course. So that's you know if anything happens then you're you guys are still good to take advantage of it. And then it's just getting the audit done then getting the work done paid for that's the invoice we're going to I mean our whole project management team is going to walk you guys step by step from A to Z on the application process and all of that. And then you get the work done the invoices submitted the second audit is completed. So that way the same auditor can confirm and checkmark everything's been done by the standard. Once we submit that then the government will send you the full amount including the audit with usually within 10 business days. How long is the full thing like process? The the the the the in like the audit and the in so we can get done you know as soon as possible kind of thing like we can get the audit booked within within I mean two to three days or less than a week kind of thing. We can get the work done you know whenever your preference is. So ours is you know we have technicians and experts all throughout the province. So you know our availability and same with the auditors we would assign a licensed auditor kind of within your area. So we can do everything within less than a week or what your preference is as far as the government incentive. From A to Z it's usually around a six to eight week period on average. Okay that's just for the money to be given right? Yeah like for the the audit application the second audit and then of course the them sending you the the money. Okay but that's basically from the three I'm A to Z like from getting your audit done to getting receiving the funding. Okay. Okay. I am the only one on my house. So it's okay to just have me on there right? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah usually they just only one name is needed like I deal with you know spouses or whatever people that are multiple people in the home but they they prefer to easier for just one name to be listed so that's not an issue. Okay. How is the overall like you said your overall credit standing and all of that is is good right? Mine is good. He's not so much. Yeah they're not going to look at his because it's if your name you said that's on the home right? Yeah. Yeah so we would be putting everything in your name so he wouldn't even be looked at at all. Okay. I mean the approval rate to about 98 percent. I even had one of my clients and I do with my hundreds of clients. I've helped with the loan. I haven't had one client. Not kind of would do want to jinx it but how come back with a decline? I don't know. Sorry what was that? No no no I just like because it's like I don't want to be that one to pick you down. Yeah well well you're seeing your you know what the government with this program surprisingly because it's you know it's quite a bit that they're offering for a long period. They're actually they're actually super lenient. They're even more lenient than our partner financing. Sorry? Oh okay well they should be it's a loan and really when you think about it how much money they're taking on carbon emissions and trying to lower everything so like yeah. So I just got to be going somewhere to help people. True. Yeah yeah. I have heard true. Hey anywhere you can get help especially from the government at this point. You know so but yeah I know they're pretty lenient. Like they're of course I have to say this to everybody there is always that small one percent right but like I said it's I haven't seen it as of yet I hope not too and they are quite lenient with this program as far as approval. Okay. Okay so you're going to give me the models all right. The email. Yeah I can send you the Diken model or brochure or whatever. That's not a problem. That's great. Okay so take the weekend to review it. I feel and then I will touch face to few Monday around four o'clock and you know let's take the next steps from there. Okay so good thank you Mary. Okay little problem. Yeah. Have a good weekend. Bye. You too. Bye. Bye now.

We spoke yesterday about your inquiry for a heat pump. Yes. Yeah, you say you're looking to get like I think two units, that class only for upper floor or specific room. I don't recall. Can you remind me of that? I think, can you remind me that my conversation with you yesterday because I don't recall to. Oh sure. Anyone about my units, you know, my. Okay, you call. I believe you called me yesterday around, I don't know, three or four PM. You said you have a furnace and AC for the rest of for your home, but some portion of your house, I don't know if if if it's not getting enough cool in the heat, but you're looking for a unit that class in there. I wanted to check if your panel box is okay with it or no, I told you I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's right. That's for now. Now I got I get so many things on my head. Sorry, you know, yeah, that was, yes, yes. So what exactly do you want to know from me? So just want to just tell me a bit about your situation once again. What are you back looking for? Because I figured out your panel box can be still okay and in the incentive can it still be okay for your home if you're looking just for two units for a specific area and not for the whole house that can still work. Yeah, that's right. I mean, because I got a home which is two beds from upstairs and there's some of these, everything's going on, you know, on the first floor and get only one for us and those two rooms upstairs that are getting a heart in there. Yeah, you know, and calls in a windtatch. So, you know, I was thinking, you know, like I was looking at in on a website and there was like a me split unit like a heat. Okay. And I was thinking maybe that will work for me because those two rooms upstairs that they are not, you know, like they are almost up on the other side of the house. So, what do you think? Yeah, I did talk that I did kind of like discuss your situation with the manager yesterday and he said it's all good both with the incentive. Like, you can still qualify for the entrance free funding program. If you want to take get like only two like mini-slads for the per place only that can still work and your panel box be okay too. So, now, while her, what I can do as I can like set up an online consultation with one of her advisors, she will provide you with the prize and the product that we offer. And we'll discuss the funding program with you as well that if you like it, you can go ahead. Okay. Yeah, okay, that will be great because I don't know if that's somewhere congee from your company or somebody else. Really? You know, there was there was pushing for, you know, a pit palm, you know, a rebar, a de pad. You know, I'm ready for that because you know, I don't know how I'm going to lift in just home and and you know, like my phone is between you and my host from my air conditioner. So, I'm not ready to play. Yeah, you don't think too. Yeah. Just the two rooms. Yeah, he was pushing the houses. Yeah, he wasn't, you know, he was pushing like crazy and I said, thank you very much. But, you know, I'm not going to take your offers and if someone is going to call me and talk to me about those two rooms, I'm more than, yeah, I agree with you. Okay. Sure. And your house, like, when was it built? What year? The 1000 was built in the 2013 or 2012, you know. Do you know the current better of the two rooms? Sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. You know, it was built new and those two rooms upstairs and phone is on one side of the house that I condition and those two are a mother house, another side of the house. So, you know, that's right, probably it's a far distance and we are not getting enough heat or air condition. You know, we are located in Mrs. Saga if you want to know that. Sure. Okay. And do you know this? Sorry what? How about your business? Where do you are? We're in North York. North York, Toronto. Yeah. Do you know the birth footage of the upper floor, like the bedroom?

She'll pass this program with you and go through her numbers as well. Okay. Okay. When is the best time to have this? The best time we can do like on Monday at... Monday is good because... 15pm? Okay. All right. So, you're going to send me a link or something? I will. Just quickly tell me a bit about your home. Like when was your house built? What year is the house was built? Probably close to 100 years. I will say 1920. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 100 years. 80, 90, I don't know. It's a bungalow or a two-story. It's a commercial building. Commercial building, like an apartment. We live upstairs and the main floor is a coffee shop. Okay. So, the main floor is a shop. Coffee shop. And on top of the coffee shop, there is the unit at 11, right? I need a unit for the coffee shop and upstairs as well. Okay. Is it like a duplex like two units? One is the coffee shop and the other is the place you live in? It's a storefront, you know? Two stories. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. And how big is the area? Like how big is your home, the one you live in, the unit? 2200 square feet. 1200, the main and the top is 1100. Okay, so 1100 is the one which is the coffee shop and 1100 is the one you live in, right? Yes, yes. Okay. And do you have a furnace in your home? We have a radiator. A radiator, okay. The heat is radiator. But the radiator is for the whole building. Okay. But our main feature we're looking for is the air-conditioned unit as well. Okay. Okay. The good thing is the heat bomb, it does both coolant and heat em. So when you have a heat bomb, you don't need to have an AC. It does coolant in your home and you can use it for heating and the winter. So it does two jobs. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah. That's ideal, right? Yeah. Now, are you looking to get like heat bomb just for the residential area, the one you live in or also for the coffee shop? I'm looking for the coffee shop as well. Oh, as well. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right now, I have a air-conditioned unit for the coffee shop, but it's a duct. So if I can get this, I don't need the duct. So I can just... Yeah, true. Sure. Okay. And you don't have gas access, right? No gas lines there. I do have a gas line. You have a gas line. Okay. Yeah, the heating is gas and all the cooking is gas. Okay. So the radiator is heated. Like you have like a boiler system kind of thing that provides heat with the radiator. Yes. Okay. Okay. And this is your primary residence and you are the homeowner, CREP. Yeah. We are the home owners who will live upstairs and we run the coffee shop ourselves. Okay. I just need to clarify one thing with my manager. I just need to find out if your place is eligible for the incentives as well or no. Okay. Because the coffee shop is commercial, half is residential. I'm just going to talk to him quick and I'm going to call back you, call you back in the minute or so. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye.",275.9098866213152,3.837533222394995e-05,0.9528388977050781,-1.042153358459473,0.08211148530244827,107.5419954648526,0.3607707509881422,0.4656602254428341
20240524-163209_2207_+14163582911_Outgoing_Auto_2198309933042.mp3," Hi, this is Hussna Colin from Weaver, Icahome. I thought I could create on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Okay, I'm just calling out to Layna about some updates in the market. The pre-3-bay program, it has Transition and the government is now offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? No. No worries. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors. Shielded public program with you and your numbers. Okay. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you talking about the financing or are you talking about the unit itself? Oh, at the moment I'm talking about the incentive programs for kind of the greater homes. Right. Yeah. So this is not replacing anything. It's for a hit bump. Like if you want to get a hit bump in your home, you can qualify for that program, which I just talked about. So what are you exactly looking for? It's, um, it's too, okay. I house just don't have air conditioning. So I was thinking of putting in central air. Okay. So instead I'm thinking of a hit bump. The thing is Virginia's a hit bump. It does both cool and and hit them. So if you have a hit bump, you don't need to have an AC. So it's easy. Yeah. And at the same time, you can be saving on your bills with a hit bump and take advantage of the incentives. But the incentive is to replace old units, right? Not really. It's just like, um, do you have a friend that's in your home now? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So when you get a hit bump, it will be having an outdoor unit outside your home at an indoor unit, and it gets connected to your furnace. So you don't remove your furnace. You keep your furnace there. Right? And this hit bump is going to replace your AC. So you don't need to have an AC when you get the hit bump in your home. Right. Okay. But it doesn't replace your furnace. You keep your furnace. It's a backup. Right. Yeah. I thought we, uh, incentive program is, um, where for replacing old units, uh, or units, uh, or anything that would be making your footprint. Yeah. The energy usage lower. I'm actually going to be increasing it, right? Not really. Like, as I said, when you have a hit bump, you'll be using your furnace only as a backup. So only when days, it's like beyond minus 25 Celsius outside. Only in very cool days, you'll be using your furnace as a backup. Other than that, all the time, it's the heat pump that's going to be running. So that's how you'll be saving on the gas bill. And they're not going to cost you, you know, increase in carbon footprint. That's what you're saying. Right. And, um, is that what the government program is going to cover? It's, there is like, uh, as I said, if you qualify, they have a criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a hit bump in your home. At zero percent interest rate. And you give this interest free money for a period of 10 years. 10 years? Yes. And you can qualify for up to 40,000. You don't need to use all of that, but that's why you can qualify up to. So this is the best product. 40,000. Yes. Interest free. That's crazy. Yeah, I know. Like, people who are looking into multiple upgrades in their home, you know, somebody like looking to get a walk. Get a water tank, when those don't heat and then cool and whatever, they can take advantage of the whole, like, you know, the whole money at your person interest for a period of 10 years. But if you guys are looking for the heat pump, you can just go for a heat pump itself. That's it. Like, just use that. I'll take a amount of money. What is also covered if I wanted to say I. I have a house that has a metal roof. And I have a very sunny spot. Is it covered like solar panels as well? Yeah, for solar panels, you can use this program for panels as well, solar panels. I just want to like go through the criteria with you first. You should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. Yeah. The house shouldn't be a new bill because new bill houses did not qualify. It should be at least six months older more. Okay. And it shouldn't be a condo or a pertinent. It has to be a house because the pertinent not qualify. And you should be a Canadian citizen or a peer holder with a fair credit score, no bankruptcy. That's it. Right. Yeah. Okay. Now Virginia, what I can do as I was saying, I can ask you for a talk with one of her advisor. She will provide you with the price and the product that we offer. And we'll just cut this program with you as well. Then if you like it, you can go ahead with it. Okay. Okay. How many of it about your home like when was your house built? There's two parts of the house. The new part is where I have a furnace. And that's where I live. And that's where I'm thinking of the heat pump. Then there's the old part of the house. Which is heated with a like a. A gas rat radiated kind of thing. So you turn it on and it heats up. The whole unit there. So other than that, it doesn't have. No doctor. Yeah. Yeah. It has a little water tank and it doesn't really have like. Yeah. Sure. Doesn't have air either. Oh, I see. Okay. And are these two parts of the house like side by side or on top of one another? Side by side. Side by side. There is one entry to the house or two entries. Like every part has a separate entrance. Yeah. Yeah. Are they like under one address or a different address? One address. One address. Okay. And what is this core footage of your part of the part that you live in? Okay. I don't know. But I did have somebody true. I was a little bit of a person. I was a little bit of a person. And they were quoting me for a two. Is it two times? 2000. Is it right to time? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. And the furnace that you have. Is that like a gas furnace? Yes. Okay. And how old is that one? So I say, um, not very old. This house here was built. It's a house that was built in 2016. Okay. Okay. Okay. And do you like own both of the parts or are you the owner of both of them? Most parts of the house? Yeah. I own the whole thing. Yeah. Okay. And I'm moving here in the process of getting my house by primary house that I live. Getting it ready to put on the market. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Okay. Okay. And let me check here. Is the other part of the house like on rent or what? On what? Are you like rent on the other half of the house? No. No. Now, okay. I see. If your house is kind of like considering the complex like two units. Or one house with two parts. One house. Yeah. Two parts. Okay. The email address just want to confirm if V, waypangatiyahu.com, is that correct? Correct. And the home address, what I have here, it's only on perio. Can I get the exact address please? 69. Main Street. Lainman? I-N-D? M-A-I-N. OK, main street. A Marmaral, right? OK, got it. Is it like K0, OK, 2M0? That's correct. Perfect.

He's going to Friday pray. He's in the mosque and he not taking his phone with him when he goes to the mosque. Gotcha. We can definitely figure out a way of helping Mehmat as well. The only thing that I would say though is that tank less is not including the 0% loan. Okay. We can add it to the financial. The financial site. The financial site. But the heat pump would be added for the loan but not the tank less. So what about the Ontario government don't give that need tank less? 0%? Yeah, they don't. And how much the loan for a tank less? There is no loan on the tank less. We need to pay cash? We would do it like you guys don't have to pay cash. We can still give you a proof for that for the through our in-house financing. But it won't be at 0% through the government. It would be. There would be some type of 7.99 enters on the costs. Is that possible if we get the tank less and you just whoever come they just install it for us? There won't be responsible for that. I don't think that would do it. No. Okay. Okay. No problem. That's something I will talk with my brother as well. You when you started. Otherwise I will convince him to keep the same one what you have it. I'll try to whatever he said to me. But one thing Alex we need to do. The air condition is not the appropriate way where it's supposed to be. He wants to put heat pump on the other side. Not the same side where the air condition is. Yeah I can ask for his address. Take a look at the image on Google and then show my guys so they can they can see if we can do it because he wants to do it on the other side. Yeah.

20240524-142408_+14164094573_Incoming_Auto_2198270966042.mp3," This call is being recorded. Hello, Mr. Stupis. How good to have you? My name is Joe Valencia. I had an installation while back of just calling to find out the status of the rebate. Okay, sure. Let me just check that for you. Just give me a minute. Okay. I see that you did get the first energy audit done with the government auditor, Daniel. Correct. Yeah. Okay. So I see that the file has been submitted from our end and it's with Daniel right now. Did you get a chance with him recently about when it's with them or he he's not going to be able to do that. Daniel or he I thought he already submitted because I think he actually I think that as she sent an email to both you and I at one point saying that it was submitted. Okay, let me just look at that email. Right. And you had asked for the invoice as well. If I'm not wrong. I'm sorry. You had asked for an invoice which was to be sent to Daniel as well. That was a document. Yeah. Right. Yes, so everything's been submitted then. So how can I help you? How long does it take? Well, now that the file is so it's basically a thing is that the. Daniel has also submitted the file now to the government and we're basically waiting for them to process it and send the check directly to your mail. When it comes to timeline with this, I cannot give you an exact timeline because I'm not sure if you're aware, but there's a lot of backlog on the government center right now. So they're dealing with it and they don't give us any timelines as to when exactly are they present like we don't even know which months are they dealing with right now processing the files that they are right now. So I cannot. Yeah. Is there a way to check like online like to see the status or. I would recommend there's two specific ways. One is you can contact Daniel. He would know what is going on because he has access to the ported or you could also get in touch with Enbridge directly. If you give them your file number, which would be your energy audit report. Let me just double check. Okay. Okay. So the file number. What would I find the file number just checking and looking at the report now? I don't see a file number. Did Daniel share the pre and post audit reports with you? He says, Hi Joe attached is the audit reports. Right. So now the if you look at the name of that file. It's some alpha numeric number right one. Okay. So that's one X. Yeah, so the D is the report for your pre audit and the one that has an E in it. That's the post audit. Three files for the pre audit and then two files for the post audit for total five you have. If you would notice other than that alphabet D or E everything in that number is same. So if you give that number to Enbridge and you ask for an update on the status, they should be able to help you because if we ask. They deny giving us any information saying that only the homeowner can know that information. So I think it's that if you contact them directly. Yeah, and so. So how do I know that Daniel submitted it? I guess I just call him right to find out. Yeah, or you could just check with Daniel himself because he also has access because I'm not sure how does the like how well is the. Enbridge customer support functionally. So if you check with Daniel, he should be able to tell you everything about the status as well. Okay. Okay. So whatever you say. Yeah, you're most welcome. Yeah, just. Yeah, everything on our end has been done. The file has been submitted. So now it's just waiting for the government to process and send it to you. Okay. Thank you so much. You're most welcome. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye.",278.8619047619048,-0.0001312395324930549,0.9277204275131226,-0.9601548910140991,0.05350065976381302,182.3597732426304,0.2650269541778976,0.4900269541778976

But if you give them a call, they will guide you. All right. And let me just just bounce something off here a bit. When I had trouble through the winter and then they would I think they came three times and just stared at the thermostat and they never even put the hand over the heater to see that it was just the air and the host being circulated. It was very, very frustrating for me. Okay. And now we're getting into air condition time. Right. So the heat pump was running. But I might have pushed some wrong buttons here because now the heat pump does nothing. Okay. So if you call equal be they're going to do the thermostat with you.

I think you are walking me through your experience in sales or whatever you're saying. If you may continue now. Yeah, absolutely. So just quickly, just to recap, started as a personal trainer, got comfortable selling face to face, figured out that sales is my passion, moving to the retail side of things, then COVID hit. So, it took me about 50% of our leads. Same warm from our website. And so it was really just about connecting with the customer, understanding their needs. Uncovering some things that they maybe didn't know about. And then being able to find a fit with our solution there. Yeah. Being able to fit those needs. payroll, time attendance, and HR, so I was selling that directly to business owners or executive level customers. That's what I was doing there at ADP. I got really comfortable in cold calling, prospecting, using the full sales cycle to pitch and sell. Then, of course, there was another side of it where we were presenting the service as well, so I got really comfortable in using Zoom with my customers to be able to present to the service that we had. Then from there, you know, I was looking for something where I felt I'd be able to grow. That's when I moved on from ADP into the Glendale Group here, which is now a full business development position. I spent 90% of my business cold calling reaching out to businesses where I was looking for where we'd be a fit. The Glendale Group, what we do is we're a multi-trade service provider. Basically, I reach out to tenants of buildings and let them know that we want to be a service provider for them when it comes to anything to do with handyman, electrical plumbing, and HVAC. That is a strictly cold call position, and then I'm also out face to face doing some of my own introductions. That's kind of where I'm landing right now. Okay, so are you still working with Glendale Group? Yeah, so I am currently still working with the Glendale Group. For me right now, what I've seen over the past couple of months is that it's not quite the best culture fit for me. It seems that a lot of my colleagues here are a little bit old-school, a little bit older. So I just don't see that. It's the best culture fit. And so I am looking for something where I feel a bit more comfortable in the office, and I feel like I've been a while reaching out. I think that the experience and the skills that I've kind of built over the past five, six years really would make me a good fit for this position. And that's why I've been to my resume. Okay, perfect. So I think based from the overview of your experience, you kind of suitable for the position that we're looking for. So I wanted you to come in the office for a face-to-face interview and Monday. Yeah. Should that be a good day for you? Yeah, that's hard. Okay, can I book it any time on Monday? Yeah, anytime I'm available. See, just let me know whatever works best. I'll be able to come in there. Okay, perfect. So I'll do it around 1 p.m. Yeah, that's perfect. Okay, sure. So I'll send you an email today after our call that will confirm the day in timing and also the address of our office. We are located in North New York. So I can see from your seat with you, Dan, you need an Ahtorn Ham? Yes. Is there a problem for you or no? No, no, absolutely not. I'm right here at Youngin's Steel, so coming over there is no problem. All right, perfect. And also I don't have your email address on your resume. Can you just provide it for me, please? Yeah, absolutely. So it's Josh, J-O-S-H. Okay. Period. My last name, Carvalo, C-A-R-V-A-L-H-O. Perfect. Okay. 5 at gmail.com. So basically it's your name that you're surname 5gmail.com. Yeah? That's correct. Yep. All right, thank you so much, Josh, and I will send an email now and I will see you on Monday. Great. Thank you so much for your time. I'll see you Monday. All right. Bye. Have a great weekend. You too, bye now.",328.5419047619048,3.819567427854054e-05,0.9277204275131226,-1.204253196716309,0.06099269539117813,198.5101587301588,0.3506369109817385,0.5638499112637042
20240524-113201_2282_+19056917204_Outgoing_Auto_2198212485043.mp3," Good morning, Maryland speaking. Hey, Marlene, how are you doing? It's Alex from Weaver. We talked two days ago about the hip-hop particles. Thank you for sending all that information over. Do you receive the one that I sent you yesterday? Yeah, I did. Yeah, I was going through it. I left it on the kitchen table for my husband to go through it when he gets up this morning. That's amazing. So we didn't manage to get our air conditioning fixed. It was just a very small problem. So I think you were mentioning that there's another rebate coming up in beginning of June. Yes. So we do have a little bit of time. It's not as serious an issue as no air conditioning. So we're going to go a little bit slower and make sure we make the right decision on it and maybe wait to see what that rebate is. Yeah, the rebate would definitely be a good help because the good thing about the rebate is that you can combine it with the loan as well. Yeah, now that loan is not a situation where only certain number of people get it, right? Anybody can get it. Like it's not a quota sort of thing. It is based on a quota, but it's a little bit on how can I say this? It's a little bit on a first-come-first serve basis where there is a couple qualifications. It has to be your primary home. It has to be like you have to be the homeowner to prevent people from getting it for every cause like, especially nowadays in Canada, especially in Ontario. There's a lot of investors that own multiple properties. Yeah. Just for preventing people from using it, like let's say for five different properties, they're only making it for the primary home and owners. Okay, so have you heard of any people not getting the loan because of the quota basis? Like, I guess there are only so much money that's available through the government and then they end it? That loan actually came from the rebates before, right? With the rebate before, there was a lot of, like, because the rebates were so big, like 6,500 people were getting previously. A lot of people were not really like, since every single person was selling heat pumps, a lot of people were getting stuff promised that they did not get the liver in terms of they got an install pay for, but they never got the rebate. So what they did is that they moved that budget towards this loan and they made it a lot more strict in terms of like what actually equipment qualified for it, what, you know, like the criteria to qualify for it in terms of, you know, being the primary home. So as for now, we haven't heard anything that they will take it away. So for now, it's still going. And our biggest question that people ask us all the time is, I can they make the loan with the rebate? And so far, you can. Yes, it's something that you, the rebate is not going to be as much as before. I'm still waiting on the specifics just to be able to send it over to all my clients who are waiting for it. Okay. But the good thing is that the same energy outed that we work for the loan, it will be the same energy outed that it could qualify for the rebate as well. So we could go ahead and start with that. Exactly. If it's something that you choose to, it's something because the loan takes about two to three months to get approved and you don't get that money. But the rebate is instantaneously, right? Once you do the first outed, if you do pass on it and you get it installed, the rebate that will be able, I believe that might be able to fund you the funds on like ten days notice something like that. Okay, so the rebate is more, and how long does it take before you know that you qualify for the loan? It takes about an average six to eight weeks. Oh, it does, okay. Yeah. Okay, and can you apply for the loan before placing the order to see whether you qualify or not? For the loan, what they do need to see is that you for sure need to do the energy outed. Right. So for us, for example, if we would do it for you, it would have to be already after you send agreement. If you don't get the loan, you have to go ahead with the, with what you've ordered. We have a couple of options, the way that I do it for people who usually have like a smaller amount, which means just the heat pamphlet they. I usually get them approved for the 7.99% and if they don't get approved, they're still going to be saving money. Paying that amount so I leave it that way in your case. If there's no rush and it's not a hurry, what I would do is get you approved if you need the funds up front. We can get you approved from like a six month zero percent interest. And if it's fixed to a week, you don't get approved for the loan. What we could do is just avoid the whole thing and cancel the whole agreement. Okay, that's what I wanted to know. Perfect. Yeah, we do have the big sum of money in. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. Okay. All right, those are all good answers to the questions that I was thinking about. I'm going to, it looks like really good products that you've picked for us. So I get my husband to, he's also having major surgery on Monday, so that's why I want him to take a look at it now before he's not able to think. For at least a week. Okay, so that's a thousand percent because what we could do in that case is and we can leave this all alone that I will. Of course, add this all to the agreement for you guys is if you guys will be interested in the service, you know, the price. What we could do is get you for the first out of it. You would get it done after that first out of it, we will start the paperwork for the government and we would have an idea if you get approved for not. And the time he's already recovered, he's already doing better. That's when they can go over and actually install the whole service once we know you got approved. That's something that you guys could think about too. Perfect. Well, I think I'll hear that you're, yeah, go ahead. If you're any chance that you could just send me an email with those couple of points that so that I can add it to that we can get that interest free loan and wait for six months. I think you said what's that? It's six to eight weeks. Six to eight weeks. Okay. While the loan is being processed. Just because by the time I get home, I'm going to forget all of this. I can build it up in an email. It's in the juice. So you guys have it. I really, really appreciate that. No, not a problem. No, not a problem. Early. Okay. Thank you again. All right. Bye bye. Bye bye.",440.9338775510204,-0.0001099579603760503,0.7148853540420532,-0.7604922652244568,0.0646604374051094,184.562358276644,0.2187401883830455,0.4916684109541252

Oh, it might stick in to Linda. Yeah. Oh, hi Linda. I was just calling you a bit earlier today. I got an inquiry like your inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. Are you looking to get a heat bump installed in your home? Well, I was a pro, a film, an opal mess had called me. And I was approved for that. I was approved for AppLinesis. And he never called me back. It's just going back on Wednesday there and now. And I try to call them back. It never calls or I couldn't get a hold of them. Oh, I see. And what, how did you speak with before? Thomas. Thomas. Oh, I see. There's nobody by that name here.

Could that date for the heat pump? And I have and I have 7,000 for AppLinesis washer dryer fridge stove. And there's washer and the microwave. Oh, I see. Did the job like was the heat pump installed or no? Nobody came. Okay, I don't know. Yeah, for this. We get the calls and then they approve us and they don't drink and show it to their face up. Oh, I don't know why they're doing it. Lost out. I have no idea to be honest, but we can definitely help you with the heat pump like we are a track company with you heat pumps. So yeah, if you want to get a coat from us, I can help you with that. And what about the AppLinesis? No, we don't do a plan says we do like a hidden and cool and he's up and we do other stuff like water tank or what the attic installation air sealant, the actual but not the appliances that you're referring to. And how much would that cost me for the heat pump? Oh, yeah, Linda, I myself work as an appointment booker. I cannot provide you with the exact price, but if I could give you a range, it would be anywhere from a 4,500 to 6,500. Because I can't pay that cash. Yeah, no, sure. There is like a government incentive program available. I'm not sure if you're aware of it or no. But if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at 0% interest rate. And you get this interest free money for a period of 10 years. And the example if I want to sell house again, so if you sell the house, this it will get transferred to the new owner. You don't get to suck with it. I mean, who pays the I have to continue my payment. Like whatever as I said, whatever is the price for the heat pump, you will get the money from government at 0% interest. And then you have a period of 10 years to pay it back. And it's all interest free. Yeah, okay. Yeah, what I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the exact price and discuss the product as well. Okay. All right. Can you just tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? It's a no house. It's a bungalow or two story. It's just a regular house upstairs main floor in the basement. What's the house size and the square feet like roughly? Oh, boy. I'm not sure.

20240524-124826_2208_+14165657939_Outgoing_Auto_2198237795042.mp3," Hello. Hey, they're Frances. Yep. This is Kaya. I'm sorry I'm not spread around. Yeah, I was, I don't know if it was the Internet connection or if it was such a long delay, and I wasn't able to hear you. Yeah. Sorry, you were saying something, but I wasn't, I didn't hear anything you said. Oh, I think you're asking me what I thought of things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the price that you gave is somewhere, I don't know, maybe in the middle between some of the quotes that I've got. I get that your obviously a reputable company and all of that and there's certainly value there. In terms of warranty, if I were to compare it to some of the bigger ones there, they've got a better warranty because they, they use include longer labor warranty. In terms of incentive, I guess anybody can give me the greener home alone, that's just directly with the government. So while you can help me out with the paperwork, it's kind of independent of who actually does the work. Either way, I need to get the audit done. So, you know, I'm just going to put all the quotes together, connect together. That's the products that you're getting quoted for are also on the list. Oh, exactly right. That was the biggest thing that happened with the rebate. That was what I was saying with the scams and the fraudulent things that were happening with the rebate, which is why the government completely put it to a stop, is because homeowners were, you know, unfortunately getting fooled by contractors and companies saying, hey, this heat pump is going to qualify, you were going to help you with everything. They, you know, they installed it, they paid for it upfront or financed it for 15 years or whatever. And then they're now finding out months and months later that it didn't even qualify at all for a rebate. So that's, you know, that's a production of a product to show which ones qualify. You can go on the government website, I believe, and they should have, it should be a way to locate what's on the list. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then also the auditors too, because the auditors, you know, there's a list of, you know, certified or licensed auditors that also have to be on that list, if either embridge or through Canada Greeners directly. So they can show you the list on the website as well. But again, this is why, you know, this is why on our end, I mean, our pricing is super competitive based on what we're offering. We can look at, you know, let's say, for example, the blade excite you were quoted significantly less. I can look at that system and probably give you a much less quote as well. But it kind of defeats the purpose of the, of the loan, first of all. And then also of just the overall efficiency in the home, right? Why are you looking to make sorry, go ahead? Well, I mean, I don't really, I don't like playing this game, but I mean, you're saying that you have a thing where your, your lever will be in any quote by like, you know, 10% or something like that. So as long as it's comparing apples to apples, yeah. As long as it's comparing apples to apples. So if I were to get a quote just before I pull the trigger on it, if I send it to you, you go, you know what? For this same equipment, we either can beat it, match it or are unable to do that. You know, that's something that you guys would do. Absolutely. Absolutely. It is a policy that we have as long as it compares apples to apples. You know, I've done it several times for my clients. I obviously have to send it over to management for approval. But once we look at it, if it's the same product and you know, pretty much within the same, you know, services and products that we're offering, we will beat it by 10%. Okay. That sounds good. You know when you were looking to pull the trigger on your notes? Yeah, when I do it, I want to do it as soon as possible because the furnace is broken. Yeah, for sure. If we told something that AC doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is impossible, but I'm not, you know, I'm not rushing the process because, you know, I want to make sure I get the right stuff in without causing an nominal. But yeah, pretty much as soon as possible. Okay. The only reason I, I mean, you can get a heat pump been sold at any time and we can do that for you anytime. So, what I would say is maybe slightly more time sensitive is the incentive program because the government is unpredictable and, you know, as far as the incentive go. And they have advised us that they're only extending it for a window time. There is no date, of course, but that's what they've mentioned to us. So anyway, here's what I'm going to do for instance, I will send you an email with the, you know, what's the breakdown of the package, the cost and all that. Do you know when you'd be able to send me over a quote like that quote or? Well, I haven't, I haven't decided. I got to like, you know, get all these quotes. I got to kind of put them all together and see which ones are like. Sure. Which I like the best, but it'll be soon. I mean, it's Friday now. So maybe I'll do some work on the weekend on the weekend. Okay. Yeah, so it might be like more like Monday or something when all. Yeah, for sure. Have an idea. For sure. So what you can do, we're Friday today, I will send you an email soon as we get off the school with the breakdown of everything. And then if you want to, if you have some time and over the weekend, you want to send me a quote that kind of compares apples apples. When I get in on Monday, all forwarded over to management and I can give you a show and then we can go from there. Is that fair? That sounds great. Okay, awesome. What time is usually best to give you a show during the day? Maybe like 9.30, 10 o'clock in the morning. Earlier if I could do Monday, I could do 11. Is that okay with you? Sure. Okay. Okay. Sounds good, Frances. I will go ahead and send you that email shortly. If you do have any questions on my contact details or touch the email so you can always shoot me an email. Or this is my direct line, you can give me a call. Do you have any other questions for me before we part ways? Not right now, but it wouldn't surprise me if I do have some later and I'll just reach out here. Yeah, reach out. You can always email or shoot me a text on this line, doesn't matter. And then I'll wait for that quote and we'll touch base on Monday morning. All right. Thanks very much, Mariam. You have a good weekend. You too. Thank you, Frances. Take care.

I thought you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad. Are you? So from which company? It's Weaver, E.Ca home. E.Ca home. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I just written inquiry about the earth and. Oh, heat bump. Oh, a heat bump. It does cool and and heat and it works both like an ACS leather heater. It can use it in both seasons. Yeah. Okay. So now basically the main why I call so my ACS is not working right so I'm I heard from my contractor that I need to replace my AC. It's the old one. Obviously I have a furnace and AC separate. Yeah. So that's the condition I'm right now. So I have to replace my AC and my structure is working. Okay. I'm willing to know what what you can offer. Sure. So, uh, push a heat bump. It has an outdoor unit that's going to be outside of your home. Just the same way the ACS outdoor unit is, right? And that it has an indoor unit that's that's a coil and it gets connected to the furnace. And through the dock work, it's going to provide you with heat and and coolant. Okay. You'll be you don't need to like remove your furnace or anything. You keep your furnace at the back up because as far as the heat and part of a heat bump is concerned, it works perfectly fine till minus 25 Celsius outside. Only when it goes beyond that the heat bump shuts down and the furnace kicks in. So when you get a heat bump in addition to using it for coolant in summer, you can use it in winter as well and save almost 75% on your gas bill because you want to use a near furnace. You'll be using your furnace only as a backup. Okay. Okay. Does someone say anything? Yeah. Yeah. Do you, uh, do you have any idea about the government incentive programs or no? I mean, yeah. One point, the one of the reliance that was and he was explaining me six months back. But I wanted to also kind of hear it from you, right? I don't know what you're after that. Yeah. There used to be a rebate program which ended on January this year. However, for homeowners who miss out on the rebate, government had expanded a limited time interest-free funding program. So as per this one, whatever is the cost of the heat bump, government will give you that money to get a heat bump in your home at new person interest. And you give this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. Did you know about this? Or no? I don't know. What was earlier than when they were giving us grants to change? Yeah, the grant. Yeah, the grant was through Canada Greener Homes, the federal program. It was for people who would change the heat and then cool into the heat bump. It was a grant. But it ended on January. It was for end-bridge users, it was 6,500. For a non-enbridge, it was 5,000. 5,000. And what would be the total cost of insulation? Oh, I myself work as an appointment with her. What I can do is I can connect you with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the fact price and the product that we offer. But as I told you, push, there is no more rebate available. It's only the interest-free program at the moment. Okay? Yeah, that is fair, but you know, what can we do right? I didn't act on that. That's why. It's okay, but I think you said reliance, right? So do you have any of your stuff through reliance, like your furnace or AC or no? Yeah, what a heaters. It is entered. Water heater. Okay, okay. All right. You wanted to make sure. Okay. So tell me a bit about your home lake when was your house built? I told one. I think it's 1960 or 70. And it's a bungalow or two story? Bungalow. What's the house size in its square feet like roughly? Roughly 1600. And how old is your furnace? I really don't know. And do you think it's more than 15 years or less than 15 years? Less than 15 years. Okay. And this is your primary residence and you worry the homeowner is cracked? Yeah. Okay. What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. Yeah.

20240523-173721_2208_+15193309606_Outgoing_Auto_2198122070043.mp3," You're late, Colin. What's going on? Hi there. Yes, sorry, Lauren. I ran really late on my last appointment. My apologies. Are you still available now or? Yes, I am. I'm just sitting down, relaxing, trying to take it easy and whatever. Okay, okay, good, good. Relaxing is good. So thank you so much for joining me this after or this evening. Quick introduction to myself. So my name is Mariam. I have had the pleasure being with the company for about three years now. I've learned a lot about becoming more eco-friendly and more importantly helping homeowners become a lot more efficient with their homes. So that is a little bit about me. Lauren, tell me a bit about yourself. What's the name, goal, or motive for getting a heat pump installed in the home? Save money. Yeah, efficiency. Yeah. And the other problem is I need to probably purchase a brand new air conditioner. Okay. That cost is, you know, I don't know, $45,000 or whatever for a new air conditioner. So, you know, for a little extra money for a heat pump. And it takes advantage of the, you know, being able to cool the house with the heat pump and heat the house when it's like like the last couple of winners. Like you don't need to firm this anymore because it's all like the prime prime zone for the heat pump. So, you know what's, you know what's going to happen, right? What's up? The price of hydro is going to go up exponentially. And all the savings and all the green shit and everything that everybody was thinking that they were going to do. It's going to cost them in the long run. Like it seems like, and you know why? Because I'm 65 years old, okay. And I've run into this situation so many times in my life. And it's like, oh, I'm going to save a buck. I'm going to save some money here. And I'm going to purchase whatever. And then after I purchase and get involved in the whole thing, the price of the original, you know, let's say you're till watch per hour. All of a sudden double. And there goes the there goes the advantage of having, you know, difference between natural gas and just a regular air conditioner. So, I know that's coming and everybody else does. And I'm sure, you know, if you don't know, it's, it's because of the green. And I would say the green revolution. And it's going to put a very large. Demand on the grid system. And when that happens. The prices of everything, trans, you know, delivery, transportation, production of the hydro. So I'll go up. Degree or disagree? Yeah. Well, I don't want to I don't want to put it in the you know, I mean, you have a lot more experience than I do. So, but I guess the well, a couple of things. I mean with that, you're on gas, right, Lauren? Yeah. Wrong. Yeah. I'm on gas. And I don't like 85% efficient gas furnace. Yeah. 20 years old, right? Right. So I'm kind of thinking, well, I don't know, do I spend 10 grand, you know, upgrade the gas system? Or do I spend whatever to upgrade to heat pump? I would say the heat pump is probably the, I would say that's better because even let's say, you know, now you're eliminating, I mean, got your gas is not going to be eliminated 100%. But it is going to, it is going to cut down in the winter time because these high efficiency cold climate systems, the newer heat pumps. They will heat up your home efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. So your gas. Celsius or. Yes. So, yeah. Yeah. So that's amazing. You know, because they're so efficient to that temperature. So, you know, the, the, hopefully we don't get too many. I mean, it's the far end in between. We're going to get too many of those days. So it's not down, not down, not down here in southern Ontario. Yeah, you're in. I don't. I actually have a lot of family in. So I'm, I'm aware of, I'm familiar with the area. And, and this guy, guys, fish in here. All year round last year. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was nothing. It's just dirt clouds and miles. Yeah, my dad was fishing too. So, um, yeah. Up here. Who? He's just outside of Sarnia. So I have some cousins and, uh, aunt and uncle in Sarnia. And then, are you know where Wallaceburg is? Oh, yeah. Wally will. Well, exactly. Yeah. So he's, he's in there. Yeah. That's where he is. But we go into Sarnia law, especially in the summertime. Um, but yeah. So, yeah. You guys are, I mean, down there, it's, it's very uncommon to, to get temperatures like that. So the gas furnace is really only being used as an emergency backup. Yep. And that's exactly what I'm, I'm planning on just leaving it as is in the, in the basement, not replacing nothing on that. And, and just going to a heat pump. And, uh, that way I can get air conditioning and, and take advantage of the, uh, the weather to heat the house as well. So my question is, um, with the air conditioning that I already have, yeah, would the heat pump be able to hook up to that? Or do you have to replace all the lines and, and all the, uh, exchanges and stuff? No, as long as the lines are in good condition, like they're not, uh, torn up or ruined or anything like that. And we don't, you don't have to take out the exchange or the lines, but the, the actual, obviously, the AC unit has to be replaced with the outdoor unit of the heat pump. Yep. Um, but no, the lines, um, as long as they're, like, they're running efficiently in the home, um, those don't have to be replaced. Yeah. Okay. Right? Yeah. So what would you look at? Uh, this is connecting the lines up the air conditioner and then having it hooked up to the heat pump. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So there's two parts of the heat pump. I'm sure it sounds like, you know, you're, you're a pretty good idea with the, how the heat pump works and the efficiency. So the two parts is going to be the outdoor unit and then the internal part that connects to the outdoor unit is the Unix case coil similar to an AC, but of course it's the heat pump. Yeah. And we'll be installing that in or on your existing furnace. They do kind of run in conjunction with each other or communicate with each other, but they are still two completely separate systems. Yeah. Okay. So just to clarify, Lauren, we do use like the, you know, the cold climate, the newest, uh, efficiency heat pumps. So they will go efficiently in the wintertime, uh, anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. Yeah. Temperature that will get colder than that. Um, you know, your gas furnace kicks in automatically as an emergency backup. Right. And that's exactly what I'm, I'm, I'm looking for. Yeah. And there's, to be honest with you, natural gas is pretty cheap. Yeah. And I, I, you know, I can't complain on that for the heat and the house and stuff. But if I have to replace my air conditioner, my air conditioner is going to cost me three, four thousand dollars. Yeah. If you want to high efficiency with warranty installed usually, I mean, depending on the size of the home and the unit, but it's usually between 35 to 5000 easily. Yeah. And the good thing with these newer heat pumps, um, uh, Lauren, is there actually a lot more efficient than even newer AC systems on their own. A couple of reasons for that. A because they've recently advanced the technology with heat pumps with the free on. So that's why these newer systems are so efficient. But more importantly, uh, uh, average AC systems are, you know, AC systems in general average anywhere from 10 to 12 here or 13 here. These heat pumps, depending on again, what size and brand, but they range anywhere from 18 to 25 here. Yeah. So I mean, homeowners are not just noticing what these heat pumps are not just noticing a reduction or savings in the winter time with the fuel cost. They're also noticing their hydro bills go down in the summertime as well. Yeah. And that's what I'm looking for really because, uh, well, right now there's a ton, a ton and a half air conditioner on the side of my house that like entire need of replacement. Yeah. So I contacted a contractor who took advantage of the, uh, the energy program back in December. Yeah. Last fall. Yeah. And he had a two ton unit available for like 2000 bucks plus installation. And then he gave me the quote, he gave me the quote for about $3,500 to $4,000. Right. Oh, okay. That's fine. You know, I don't mind whatever. So then I'm kind of thinking, well, it's going to cost me for a new air conditioning unit. That's going to cost me even more for the hydro to run it, right? Because it's 220. And, uh, I'm kind of thinking, well, maybe I should just check in the air conditioning unit and just go to the heat pump and forget about all this crap. And now, not only are you going to get more efficient cooling and save on your hydro in the summer. But you're going to basically, you're going to cut out your gas bill by about 70, 80%. Because the gas is only used as a backup. Right. So if you're spending like, what's your average or what does how like what's the highest that your gas bill goes in the winter? Well, we just moved into to the city, which is a whole different environment. But when I was in the country, and I had a like a $2,500 square foot house that was, I took advantage of all the energy, you know, programs. And I spray foam the outside top and bottom and then re re covered it in the whole nine yards and barely. And then had him redo and I killed a feeling full of, you know, whatever installation and seal everything off. And even in the cold month of January, when I was in the country, where there is no wind bill, where you're just whatsoever. Yeah, yeah, it's all open. 65 to 70 bucks a month. Okay. Oh, wow. Yeah, that's really low. Yeah, 25 on a square foot house. So I move into this place, which is around 12 to 14 hundred square feet. And it cost me about the same. Yeah, yeah. The city is always the pricing is always different. So what's the size of your AC like in tons, you know, 1.5? 1.5. Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. So with the heat pump, as you probably know, it's also calculated in tons. But Lauren, because now it's not just we're not just looking at the cooling aspect. We're also looking at the heating aspect as well. You always want to size up slightly with a heat pump. So for your home, I would go, I think the two tonne would be more than enough for your eyes. So I agree. And then, um, do you have a smart thermostat? Yeah, I got one that's hooked up there, everything that a schedule temperature up and down and cool up and down and all that stuff, right? Do you know how long ago did you get it installed? Is it recent? Well, I couldn't figure out the one that they had here back in November. It was completely nan or so like. Oh gosh. So I just tore it out through it down and got this one that was only like. I got, you know, I bought it, whatever. So I can program the tent up and down at night and weekdays, weekdays and all that stuff, right? Okay, you know if it's a eco beer, is it a nest? What? Is it the nest smart thermostat or the eco beer? Or you're not sure? Well, I don't know what's the difference between a smart one and whatever. Oh, it's just a brand. So you can, it's, it's, uh, it connects to Wi-Fi, right? And you can, and you can control the temperature? No, no, mine's not that high-tech. Okay. If it's brand new, you just shut it in. And it's a program of one, not a problem. It should be compatible with the heat pump if you don't fancy a smart thermostat. Otherwise, the usually we would use it, you know, include it. The thermostat is at least in my worries. Like I mean, the heat pump shows up and if thermostat coincides with the heat pump. Okay. Okay. So we'll do that. So we're going to cost me an extra $1,500 or whatever for a thermostat and then have it set up. So then, you know, when the heat pump sort of rains of efficiency, the gas kicks in or gas kicks in to help, right? Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So we'll include that. And then we have our warranty. So it's, uh, the good thing with the warranty is it is done separately or directly through us. So it's not just like your basic manufacturing. For the standard, it's 10 years all parts, one year labor and you do have 24 seven service access to it at all times. Yeah. And then, uh, of course, the, the hot water too. No, the hot water. Yeah, no, unfortunately, that would be kind of like a boiler system. No, I'm kidding. Yeah. That's the next step for heat pump. Well, there is it. Sorry, are you talking about the heat pump water heater? Or. No, have you heard of that? Yeah, well, I'm getting one put in. Oh, okay. Oh, awesome. Yeah, they do have heat pump, uh, heaters for the pool. And then they also have a heat pump, uh, water heater as well. Like, if you replaced your, your tank. It uses off, it uses like super minimal, um, energy. They say like a large tank uses like less than a forty watt light bulb. So it's super efficient. Um, okay. So if you wanted to look at, I'm, I'm assuming you kind of want to get an idea on a, on a quote, right? Or like the car. Yeah. So if we're looking at the even with the hot water deal. And have it separate, separated out from the heat pump. Like I mean, do you understand what I'm saying? Uh, the water heater, you mean? Yeah. Or the, no. Yeah, I can give you the heat pump, the heat pump is one quote. And then if you can, if you can get energy from the heat pump, to produce hot water. Yeah. You can't. No, you can't, you can't, unfortunately, because they're air source straight. So it would be two separate things. Okay. So for your home, like, so this would be like what the quote that I would be giving you, uh, Lauren would include like the full hybrid heat pump system, the two tons. And of course, it's the cold climate, you know, highest efficiency. Uh, so you get the outdoor unit, the indoor unit, the smart thermostat warranty and installation. All land you'd be looking at 6,200 plus 850. Okay. So that doesn't sound too bad. Yeah. It's pretty, it's a little bit higher than an ace, getting a high efficiency AC with a warranty. But now, I mean, you're going to get your return back in less than a year, uh, because the, the heat pump obviously is not just the cooling part of the heat, it's the heating part too, right? And these systems are super high efficiency. I mean, they will have maintained well. They last approximately 15 years plus. Yeah. Okay. So. So I'm 65. So by the time I'm on 80 or 85, I won't, I won't need to worry about it too much. You won't need to worry about it. Yeah, exactly. That's, that's what I'm looking at, right? Yeah. I'm looking at $4,000, $5,000 for a freaking air conditioner. Exactly. It does. 45,000 bucks. Yeah. 45,000 bucks. And you haven't really hit the sales point yet. Have you? What's that? Intest free loan. Oh, yeah. So I thought that was going to be my next question. So, um, of course, you're aware that they're, you know, that they are no longer offering rebates, but they did extend the Southern Census program, which is the, so I guess you, you do know about it. It's the, um, government funding for 10 years. Uh, if you're approved, it's 0%. So is that something that you're also interested in as well? Mm-hmm. Okay. So, um, good, good. Tell me what you want to give me. Somebody want to give me some money for nothing? Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'll pay it back. I'll pay it back very, very nicely over the next 10 years. Yeah. And they give you a period of 10 years. So it's completely open-learned. It's not, it's unsaccured. Um, the only thing. So there's a couple of requirements. As far as the eligibility goes, it is pretty straightforward. I mean, the approvals at 98%. Okay. As long as you're Canadian citizen, as long as you own the home, it's your primary resident. You don't have anything major on your credit to like a bankruptcy proposal. Oh, no. It's an fairly good credit standing. I got a really good credit. Awesome. Super good. Um, now the government is only accepting limited applications right now because they have advised us that they are ending this program shortly as well. But the good thing on our end, uh, Lauren, is we work very closely with the auditors in the government process. So we are able to secure in the applicant applications for our clients to cross Ontario. Oh, you're good. Yeah. One of the requirements. I'm not sure if you know this. Um, do you know what an energy audit is? Oh, yeah. I had one done when I regid my house in 2016. Okay. And I got about five or six thousand dollars back. Oh, I had to get an independent auditor to come in and I paid him. I don't know. Two, three hundred bucks to do it. And order, you know, like, I've heard. Yeah. And that's the part I just, I don't understand. I know. I know. And I guess it's part of their very verification process of what's happening. Yeah. Yeah. It is. So the government anytime it moves in, sends a program. So you've taken advantage of rebates or incentives in the past. Anytime they have an incentive program, an energy audit is required. So, um, I don't know. Um, I don't know. I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, the paperwork that gets submitted and how they qualify you. So to speak on the home, um, there's two audits that's done, as you probably know, a pre audit and a post audit. Um, total cost is seven hundred to cover both. The government will fund that back to you though, like on approval when, when you know you get approved for the, the interest rate loan, but it is a requirement. Yeah. So the good thing on our end, like I said, we do work with most of the major auditing companies across Ontario. That's something we would be able to coordinate and essentially schedule for you, um, as soon as possible. Sure. Sounds good. So that would be the only difference, uh, with going with the incentive program versus not, is you do need to get the audit done. Um, but, uh, so yeah, I guess that's, uh, I know you kind of wanted the bottom line and you had a really good understanding of the, uh, the, uh, heat pump system. Um, your AC is not working like it did it stop working completely as of now. No, it's, it's still working. Okay. It's just old. Yeah. And it's old and it needs to be replaced. That's all. Right. I see. So what is your, like, you know, as, especially if you want to take advantage of the incentive, uh, to get the stun essentially, uh, ASAP. Yeah. Okay. You know, like, I mean, the hot weather is coming here. Yeah, it is. It is. Yeah. The last plan I was just dealing with a, their AC completely broke down. The last couple of days. So, so I get it. It's, uh, it's super hot. So, um, well, you know what? I, um, I worked my whole life shift work for 25 years before I had air air conditioning. Right. So I know what's all about. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, no, I was just going to say, uh, Lauren, one is the, uh, one of the other requirements I forgot to mention to you with the, with this incentive program. Similar is the similar to the rebate program, you know, before as well. The government needs to not only see that you've gotten your audit done, um, but, you know, obviously that, um, you've applied, you've gotten the installation completed and the work paid for because that's the invoice that you have to submit. Um, you know, they need to see that it's been installed and paid for in order for them to refund you the full amount or fund you them up the amount. Um, so I just wanted to mention that, uh, that is the requirement as well. Um, so yeah, I just, okay, okay, perfect. So I guess based on everything that I've gone over with you as far as the, you know, the package, the pricing, um, the incentive program. I think the biggest thing, I mean, incentive programs are great and all, but I think the biggest thing is the efficiency and how, you know, what the return is going to be for you going with a heap of verses AC, right? Um, of course, the incentive program and then our entire process, what are your thoughts? Uh, like I mean, I'm game for, you know, it's going to cost me two to three thousand bucks extra for a heap up over air conditioning unit and end up in, you know, gain on cooling and heaving. You can't lose. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I, I would agree. So what we can, what we can do, I can walk through basically the next step because you, I mean, you can get a heap pumped on at any time, you know, that's obviously always there. I would say with a little bit more of a sense of urgency or time sensitive, is this incentive program? Um, as they've advised us, I mean, just like the rebates, they kept us in the loop as well. So if I look, I know you're in Sarnia, the first thing would be to secure an attentive date with the licensed auditor for the audit. How, how soon, like you prefer weekdays, weekends or it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It's all good. So I'm just going to quickly walk you through the steps, as far as, you know, how the process works. Number one is I would have to send you a virtual agreement. And if you're going to do two things for you, Lauren, number one, we're going to secure in the application for you for the interest for loan. Number two, we're going to secure in that tentative date with the licensed auditor because it is the first come first served with them. Hi. In doing so, so in securing, we'll then starting the process, there is a $500 security deposit required. It's not an additional amount. It is included in the $6200 I quoted you. It's just a simply deposit. And then what will happen is the auditor will come. They'll complete the, you know how the process works. And then we can coordinate once the auditor is completed that we can coordinate the install, you know, pretty shortly after. But our team will also walk you through step by step on the application process. And how to submit all the documents that are required. And then what happens once you get it installed at page four and then you said you're okay with that front that does matter. Then we will get the post audit completed. So the same letter comes back confirms everything. Once that's good to go, then, you know, after that process and application, we will submit everything to the government from there. Yep, sounds good. So I do need to send you the, I know you're in sorry, did you prefer weekdays, weekends or it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. I'm retired. Okay, so if I look at sorry Mia. So I can, what I can do, Lorna, I can book a tentative date for you. We'll have to walk through the virtual agreement. I'm going to email it over. And then what will happen is everything forwards over to our dispatch team. They're great. They're going to be in touch with you. But they have more access to the auditor's schedule in your area. So that will be able to confirm it 100%. But for now, I can tentatively book you for like mid or end next week. Sounds good. So let's say, let's say Wednesday the 29th for now again, that's not seven stone. The dispatch will have to confirm it. So Wednesday the 29th. And then Lorna, I know like as far as the, you know, the payment goes other than the deposit, obviously the full payment afterwards is not required until the installation is fully completed, of course. But would you be doing it via credit card or certified? Yes. Credit card. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Let me just confirm that I have the correct spelling of your full name on file. Sure. So I have first thing, Lauren LOR and E and last name, font F O N P. Yeah, you got it. Okay, perfect. If you just bear with me about two to three minutes, I'm just going to put it, I'm going to mute you, but I'm still on the line here. I'm just going to put the agreement together. I'm just going to be about two to three minutes. Okay. Sure. Okay. Oh, sorry, very quickly, Lauren. I forgot to also mention this. We're going to include the audit fee on the this agreement as well, because when we submitted to the government, they like to see everything on one invoice. Okay. That's for you. So I just want to take them from that. Okay. All right. Give me a moment here. All right. Excuse me for a second. Flatters. ladders, place one close to the diving board, place one, you know, a little bit further away. And then I'm, I'm going to get steps from here down, you know, for getting down on the shallow end for kids and everybody else. So, diving in, people can dive off the diving board, jump in, and then climb out there, just floating around when I get out, taking it out over there. Okay, and, and, step. So now I'm in the midst of figuring out, replacing our air conditioner, right? With a heat pump. So for $2,000 difference, get rid of the air conditioner, put in the heat pump, and then it will keep the house cool in the summer, and it will keep it warm through the, well, I'm talking to somebody. Oh, sorry. Oh, you're feeling like a person? Oh, you're feeling like a person? I'm not going to live there. Well, I wasn't expecting you to say you wanted to do that, but I put it in your room. So, that's what I'm going to put along, side of the garage for drainage. Okay. It's going to be done right. It's going to be good. And people, you know, like, look at this. Like, I mean, when this is done, it's going to be primal. And the primal part is isn't going to cost me like 50 grand to have it happen. You know, like all those, you see this, all this right here, Vic, is going to go right up to the house. All this brick work. It's going to go up there up the other side, right to the house. So, and then the diving board. Like a mean. And then the garden. Okay. Okay. Hi there, Lauren. Hi. Hey there. Thank you for waiting. I am just about to email it over to you now. Just let me know once you receive it there on your end. Okay. Well, I'll check it here right now. Okay. Let me just see. Yeah. It's just sending over to you right now. Yeah. I don't see it yet. Okay. Sometimes it takes a minute or so to come through. Okay. That's good. Well, over that. Anyway. Here, we'll check it again. Let me make sure we have the right email. Yeah, see if you're keen, all right. Did it all. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's pretty easy if you just open that email. You should see where it starts signing and then proceed to document to open it up. Okay. That sounds good. Okay. My back's hurting me. Sure. Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's okay. I feel you. So, why don't we look at it here? Yeah. Did you were you able to open it up on the first page? Yeah. Okay. 72 hundred bucks. Minus five. No, no. Six. Sorry, that's 62. 62 hundred for the full heat pump system that I quoted you. And then I included the energy audit, which includes both audits. You're pre and your post because they like to have everything on one invoice. So, just hang on here. You see there's lots of stuff going on here. Okay. So I'm looking at total 6,900 bucks. Grand total 77 97. Right? Yeah. So that includes the audit after tax. Okay. And I get that audit money back. Yes. They will fund you the full. So the 100 for the full system and then the full audit. So the 700 as well. Okay. So everything that's on this one invoice, you'll get funded back. Okay. Except the price of the heat pump. Right? Sorry. What can you repeat that? I said, you just told me it was going to get everything back from this invoice. Right? Yeah. And the total is $1,600 correct? Yep, including the audit. Yep. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to get that back. You're going to get exactly. They will fund you back. The 69 will after tax. They they fund you back. Right? So including the audit and the full heat pump system. So then what's my cost to purchase the heat pump system from my house? The 6200 that I quoted you. So 6200 is the full cost of the full heat pump system with the smart members at warranty and full installation. Oh, okay. All right. And then I included the audit. And then if you can see the breakdown after the deposit, which I'm going to send you a security link after we do this because we don't want your credit card information on the invoice. So I'm going to send you a security link to put it in. That that would be the total balance that would be required the 7297 after your deposit after the installation is completed. Okay. All right. So the agreement or the is pretty straightforward. I don't know if you can see on the first page. The bottom left hand corner. Do you see two boxes there? I can see the little highlighted green signature. Yeah. So one is the signature and then the one below is just to type in your name, which should actually pop up when you click on it. Yeah. Okay. And so, my next question is. Yeah. The interest free loan for 10 years. What is the cost for me per month to pay off? For months. So it would work out to let me just add it up right now. So if we broke it down monthly. Because they give you a period of 10 years. So it's open. Yeah. But if we broke it down. Let me just calculate here. So including the audit. Just under 65. I'm just going to run up $65 per month, that's zero percent. Sounds good to me. Yeah. And then plus the extra cost for hydra to be. Yeah. So the hydro on average across the board. And so the cost of the board. And this was done all across Ontario. Is anywhere between 50 to $65 a month a year round. That's usually the average. Depending on the size of the home and how many people living in the usage, right? Yeah. And follow the two of us and probably half the time we're not going to be here. But anyway. Yeah. So it's probably probably be on the lower average. Let's say 12 times 50 is. What is that? 12 times 50 600. 600 plus the loan, which is. Zero percent correct. Zero percent. It's completely interest free and open for 10 years. Okay. And what's the loan payment? $65 a month. So for 110 a month. For 10 years. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm good for. The only thing I have to pay for is hydro. Yeah, but it's just hydro. Now you're pretty much you're eliminated. I mean, in the winter time, you're eliminating your gas by like 80, 90%. Right? Yeah. It's just there is an emergency backup. So that's the biggest advantage. And why it makes the most sense to do the, you know, heat pump versus the AC. Because the AC system is not that much cheaper. And there's no incentive on it. And it doesn't cover your gas or your heating, right? Right. And exactly. That's what I'm looking at. Yeah. You guys will probably get your return back. But we're seeing, especially with the interest tree loan. People are getting the return back within less than a year on the heat pump system. That's hard to believe. Yeah. But whatever. Yeah. I mean, it depends on the home, of course, and the averages and size. But that's usually, I mean, two years is usually the max. But your bills are pretty in your home, you know, considering the size. It's only the two of you. It will probably be quicker for you guys to get the return or payback. Yeah. Okay. All right. So. I'll, uh, scribble some crap on the. Read stuff when I get back to my computer. And, uh, if you, if you have it pulled up, you can do it right from your phone. Yeah. I usually like to walk my clients through it. So if you, if you want to, um, you still have it open or did you close it? Yeah. I'm still here. So it's pretty easy. You just, if you just click on the box, you don't even have to, you don't have to write it. Okay. Done. And then when you do both boxes, you're going to see a green finish button. You can click on. And then I'll just confirm that I received it on my end. So. I've signed it. I print my name right now. Yeah. And I'm on page two of two. Do you see a green finish button at all? Anywhere on the page? Nope. I don't. Are you zoomed in to it? Yeah. Pretty well. If you zoom out again. There is no. Okay. Set up charge. It's basically 2200 installation charge. Uh, administration. Oh, geez. Oh, no, that's. That's it. You so that's that's cancellation piece of what happens. And, you know, we don't get this very rare. You know, it's very rare. But if we've already done the audit and we've already started the install and someone wants to cancel. So like after it's been installed, then there's or in the middle of installation, then there's cancellation used. There we go. I got a finished button here now. Yes. Click on click on finish and then let me know what it tells you. It says email to me. You can email a copy or download. You are going to get a copy email to you right away as well. So you'll get that shortly. But if you want to email yourself a copy or download, you can do that from there as well. Okay. All right. I hit the email. Trimming. So. Anyway, perfect. So you'll get a copy. And then I'm just waiting to receive it. And then there's also the the security deposit. I'll have to do with you as well. Lauren. Yeah. Yeah, I just received it. Okay. So let me j",3058.421904761905,-8.84709443198517e-05,0.9964542984962463,-1.027497053146362,0.06581968814134598,1532.940544217687,0.2080209920747306,0.5155722224296989
20240523-182720_+13433631219_Incoming_Auto_2198132644043.mp3," This call is being recorded. Home, I speak into George. Yes. Hi, George. This is Hussnell, which is Colleeny with earlier today. And regards to your online inquiry about a heat pump. Yeah, I was looking for you there, a heat pump or an air conditioning unit from my home. But I live a nowhere near Vaughan and North of Gays and Awkway. Sorry, where are you? North of Gennan Awkway, Ontario, leads in the thousands. Gennan Awk? Yeah. Yeah, do you service out this way? Yes, we do. Okay, interesting. Yeah, I have a, I live in the country obviously and I'm, uh, presently, and there was central air here, but the central air unit is stopped working and sleeked out all the cool, right? So you either need a new central air unit or possibly a heat pump. Sure. And what do you have for heat and do you have a furnace? Yes, I just said they have a propane furnace. Yeah. Okay. Now, um, George, when you get a heat pump, it will be having one outdoor unit, which will be outside of your home and an indoor unit, which will be connected to your furnace. And through the dockwork, it's going to be providing you with both cool and and hidden. Yes. Okay. Do you know about heat pumps a bit? I do, I understand right? They work to a certain temperature for, uh, for heating purposes. I do have a wood stove, which is pretty much my primary source of heat for the house of furnaces, kind of our backup since we've installed the wood stove, right? Sure. Now, um, I'd just like to let you know about some of the updates in the market. There used to be a rebate program, which ended on January this year. However, for homeowners who missed out on the rebate, government extended an interest free funding program. So as per which they have a criteria, if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at zero percent interest rate. And you give this interest free money for a period of 10 years. Did you know about this before? No, I did not realize that. Yeah. Interesting. Sure. What I can do is like I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors, show this causes program with you and will provide you with a price and the product for heat pump as well. Okay. That would be great. Yeah. That would be great. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Not an issue. Tell me a bit about your home. Like it's a bungalow, like just one main floor or two floors. How is it like? It has one main floor in the basement. Right. It's a small home just under 1500 square feet. It's not an open concept, right? Like we have existing duck work and the propane furnace. Before. Yeah, we have a wood stove in the basement and we have a two ton AC unit originally that kept the house pretty cold, but it broke right away and leaked all the coolant out. And I understand like the replacement for an AC units around 5 grand, but I understand. So I don't generally run probably close to 10,000 and better much more efficient. There are much more sessions and we do actually provide kind of like a very good discount. So it's not going to be a close 10,000 actually. It's going to be a bit lower. But yeah. Yeah. So when you start a house build. I don't know the exact date, but it was built at least 30 more years ago. That was newer windows, but the installation is like it wasn't an R2000 home. It doesn't have vapor barrier. It has the drywall with like 10 foil on the back. I renovated your bathroom and I removed all the drywall and re-insulated and stuff. So I'm very good. Yeah, inside the wall. I'm looking to do a roof and it's kind of one of those do I do my roof this year or do the air conditioning this year, right? Yeah, I would love to have the money to do both, but I don't know if I could. Sure. Okay. And how old is the furnace? I know you don't use it a much, but still like how old is the president for? The furnace was converted to propane. I believe it was oil previously. I'm not sure, but it was converted in 2008. So it's pre 2008, right? Christine, you're almost okay. And the house is your primary residence and you are the owner, right? Yes. Yes. And what's the average monthly electricity bill just that are all for idea? It's gone up since we installed the hot tub, but it's roughly around $125 a month. And how much does the wood cost you annually? The wood every year, well, our first year. I'd say it's about 1350s for the wood for the wood stove, right? Do you pay anything for propane every year or no? Yeah, we do. We do pay for propane every year. It's about roughly $500 every time you fill the tanks. And since we used the wood stove, we filled the tanks twice, so we're spending it because we heat our water with propane as well. Oh, okay. Yeah, we have a propane hot water tank. So we run about $1000 a year for propane for heat and hot water. Okay. Got it. When we used just the furnace and not the wood stove, our bills were $2500 a year for propane. Oh, wow. Yeah. I had a client the other day who was saying like a $3,500 per year. And even the oil people, they kind of like sometimes they pay $6,000 a year. I'm like, okay, that's a lot of work. It's crazy that those kind of prices, right? And I just thought since when the country with power outages out here, a wood stove was, you know, unnecessary backup, but I understand these heat pumps are very efficient. And, you know, we're good part of the year with the heat pump and not. But I also thought there was a company near me that was talking about you get a free AC if you buy it in furnace and my furnace being 15 years old. What should I do here? I'm sure I'd love to have your people who know what they understand these things. Give us advice on, you know, do we replace the furnace as well? Yeah, you know, when someone comes and looks at it, they'll, you know, give us the advice on what we should do there. We like to be self-sufficient here. Yeah, we're my wife's semi retired and, you know, I'll be retiring in a few years. I would like to monthly bills to be lower. Yeah, I see. Sure. Can I get your exact address like the exact address of the house? Yeah, it's 3331 County Road 3 and it's Lindhurst, Ontario. Okay. And the postal code is K-O-E-1-N-0. Okay, thank you for that. Got it here. So now for the online meeting, George, first of all, as I said, I'm going to schedule for a talk with one of our advisors. The platform we use is it is Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. It's going to be online. Yeah. Once we get to know about the price, you get to know about the product that we offer you like everything, you can pick any day and time for in-person inspection in your place. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah. All right. So awesome. Can we look into tomorrow like 4 p.m.? Is that a good time with you at all or no? I'm off work at 4, but I'm generally driving. I think we had home till about 5 p.m. Okay. We do that or we could do it in the morning tomorrow, say 10 a.m. I have only one spot for tomorrow. That's 4 p.m. But if you're not available, it's all good. We can look into Monday. Is that okay with you? Sure. That'd be fine with me. Monday, I can do like 1, 2, 4, 6. How about 1? Sure. I just booked an answer for Monday 1 p.m. Then I'm going to send you Google Meet-In-Write right now. You can save it here at calendar. And on Monday morning, I'll email you the Google Meet link as well. So you can join us at 1 p.m. Use it in your phone or a computer. It's up to you. Okay. Yeah, I can probably use it. I can use my phone if I'm on the road or my laptop. That work, right? Sure. Yeah. Okay. All right, then. Thank you. It's my pleasure. Thank you for your time. We'll talk about Monday 1 p.m. Okay? Perfect. Thank you. All right, then. Thanks. My pleasure.

20240523-185219_2207_+16478797993_Outgoing_Auto_2198136930043.mp3," Hello. Oh, hi, is it better now? Yeah, it's good now. Awesome. Okay, so as I was saying, where was I? I say like it has an absolutely enough app. Yeah, once it reaches to minus 27, then the furnace can start. Yeah, exactly. Once it goes like beyond minus 25, the heat pump is going to shut down and the furnace is going to start working. So you use your furnace only when it's very cold outside. So that's how with the heat pump, you'll be saving almost 80% on your gas bill. Because you're using your furnace only when it's very cold, right? Right. Now, the cool part of the heat pump is it's kind of like almost the same as an AC or a bit more efficient. Like, for example, if the Sierra value for the normal ACs in Canada here is 14 Sierra value, heat pump, Sierra value is 16. So yeah. And that's it. That's a bit of a heat pump. And there are like, there used to be a rebate program before, which actually ended on January the year. However, there is still another incentive program for heat pumps, which is through Canada Green Air Homes. So, like, if you qualify, they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at 0% interest rate. And you get the interest free money for a period of 10 years. Now, the good thing about this program is you can qualify for up to 40,000. You don't necessarily need to use all of that, but that's what you can qualify up to. Okay. That is all like interest free. Yeah. Okay. So, so, like, do I have to apply for that? Or you will be like, you'll be helping me out to a new case. Yeah. We have like a separate like team for that. We call it as account coordinators. They actually deal with the whole paperwork of the this program and deal with it. So you don't need to do it yourself. We do it. We do take care of it. But that's something else. I also heard that. I also heard that like once after installing the heat pump, the companies will give me a break of up to three months. So, like, I don't have to pay anything immediately. Like after three months, I have to start paying. And within that three months, I'll get the money from the government and then pay up few. And then I have to start the installments, plans for the government. You said something like true. I have no idea about it. There used to be like something through finance. Finance IP, which is still the use, which gives you like a six months. I believe it's still going on. But that's like for six months, you don't pay anything. And then you start payment. Like, start payment. Which company. Which company are you calling from? I'm calling from the very good home. What's that? Weaver like W-E-A-D-E-R. Weaver, E-C-O-S-E-C-O, and home like home. So it's Weaver, E-C-O-H-O. We're in Northears, Toronto. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I actually honestly speaking, I'm not sure about the payment stuff. Like, I don't know that part of it. Like, I work as an appointment booker. I can schedule you for a talk with one of our advisors. She can discuss that with you in detail. Okay. Perfect. Sounds good. You also do like the free estimation, like the consultation to my home. Yeah. Like the only thing is what we do is, the J is paid or the NA. My bad. Sorry. Your name was the NA or the J? Oh, Vinay. Vinay, sorry. Okay. Vinay. So we do like the consultation like this as an online. Like we use the platform of Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. Since the online meeting, we provide you with the price, the product, our services. If you like it, you like the price, you like the product. You can pick any day and time for in-person inspection in your place. So before coming to your place, you will be having an idea of what we offer and how much. Okay. Okay. Can we do that tomorrow or it's actually morning? We don't work on weekends. But tomorrow we can look into some time like. Because I'm at the new house and I don't, I didn't got any laptop or. Like I don't have access to my laptop right now. So if I connect over the. You can connect with your phone. Yeah. You have your phone, you have an internet right to just go to your email and you can join us with it. That's not an issue. I can help you with that part. That should be okay.

I mean, did the technician explain how the product works? Yeah. And how do you rate out the technician on the scale of 1 to 5? Uh, that is a tough one because when we had the technician install it, uh, he had to go down the road and connect it through a different person's area and run a wire over to where ours is. And then another technician or someone had come out afterwards and found out that the connection is right. So, we don't have to have a wire that runs all over the place. So, they missed that. But, uh, I'm going to need to get another technician out here to just connect it from our own outlet to the house. Oh. Instead of having a wire that runs all over the place. Oh, sir, I will do that after the call. So, how would you rate out the technician on the scale of 1 to 5? Uh, you know, we'll give him a three because he missed a pretty big issue. And, uh, he could have connected it from our own outlet instead of going all the way down the road. So. All right, sir. Thank you for your positive feedback, sir. Uh, sir, should you have any concern or question? Please do not hesitate to call contact us at 123 at 1 8 0 0 4 4 8 7 2 4. So, now please, uh, could you please tell me what is the issue? So, I could write it down in the notes and send it to the dispatch team. Uh, we just need, um, a new wiring in from the, uh, the connection because we have it connected down the road at a neighbor's. Property and the wire goes to our property, but there's a closer outlet that, uh, the technician is supposed to come or he said that someone would come, but it never happened. And it's at our property. So. Oh, yes, sir. I said, but actually, uh, like we do, uh, HVAC services. It is from the Canadian telephone services. Did the technicians miss it up all these things? Yeah. Yeah. The technician had come by to test that he would send someone out. So, I was, I was going to make a call to get somebody out here to, uh, to fix that off at some point, but I just hadn't got around to it yet. Got it, sir. I'm just going to write it down in the notes and send it to the dispatch team and the dispatch team will contact you and hire, uh, and they will assign a technician and send you sounds good. That's awesome. I really appreciate you doing that for us. Yes, sir. I'm just going to do it right, right away. Okay. Thank you so much, sir. And sir, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

So, that's another program going on. And the only like good thing which I like about it is you can qualify for a higher amount of money. Like, you can qualify for up to 40,000.

You should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. Yeah. And the house shouldn't be a new build because new build houses do not qualify. It should be like at least six months old. No, this is a 30-year-old home. So, we're okay on that. All right. And it shouldn't be a condo or a apartment. It should be a house. Yep, they should attach home. Awesome. And you should be a Canadian citizen or PR holder with a very credit score, no bankruptcy. That's perfect. It's not based on income or anything else.

Hey, Frank, how's it going? Alex from Weaver. The reason for the call is we get an inquiry from this number of the call. I think it turned us down. Television. We have a three-word just talking about the call. I have a phone call. I have used to pick up a few of the phone. I don't even know the code. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Now I can hear. I have a question. I have a question. I have a question. I have a question. Have you done any inquiry about getting more information on a heat pump? On a more information on a heat pump. I didn't get that. Oh, gotcha. Because heat pump is usually devised like gives you heating and cooling for the home. It is far more efficient than furnaces and ACs. Were you online on Facebook looking at any ads or any inquiries that you have done about it? About the home. You moved for a heating and cooling. Yes. Yes. I have one install. She is very happy with it. That was great. How long ago did you get install? I think it was DMK install. My little mom. She has got it done too. She has got it done. She has got it done. Yes. Really happy. So much. I have been taking it. My case when I bought this price. It is fixed here. The condition. The condition. All the rust that I have. At the furnace. Again. It maintains. The house is. Let me see. For people who are handicapped people. I am not handicapped. It was built. Like the hall. Everything accommodates. We are sure to get from the car. To the door. From the deck. You can go outside. You can go all the way around. I think it has a lot of stuff in it. The people who lived there. Didn't really maintain it. I installed a new furnace. An air condition. This was a query system. I think both of them cost me 12,000 back. It was six years ago. From six years ago. I have included a clay awareness. It座. This is where I would have jumped completely bad. How much Sood of Caustre Center. I sell to the tour and that is almost new. It is a public 1515 thousand square feet, 1500 square feet. 1500? Okay. The two floors, on two each floor. Oh my god, that's a lot. This was space. That was a great one. I think the most important thing is that we do hear what we do here. We were instead of be sending somebody over is we would schedule a time. So one of our technicians like one of our guys will be be to be able to provide you with more information regarding the cost the price, you know. The benefits of the heat pump because it is more efficient. I don't like the fact that there was going to be seven money every single month on their gas bill on the utility bills.

Tomorrow at 24th. Yeah, I'm just 12 o'clock. Just hang on. Let me check. So, so another thing I have to continue. It's all wrong. That's not a macabre kind of worth thinking. But I've got you. There's a homicide call. The next year or two years. And make do with what I'm 93. And that's amazing. You see the problem I have. I'm trying to say. It would be good for a resale. But I would get the hell out of benefit out of it because this awareness I have the carrier. The infancy system. The same with the air conditioner. It's like it's running and you go out of the air. Like it's unknown. Yeah, because it's called the courier as coming out of the fence. Yeah, so. Yeah, so. Yes, so how much do they usually cost? Let me see because it's. They're going to be the ones who have all that info. All I do is I just set the appointment for them. Just so they can go over everything with you. It's playing a lot better. Give you a prize.

Early high efficiency. I'm just having a high efficiency air cleaning system. I know which did. Reliance doesn't know how to look after. And one last question. Do you know what year the house was built? In 2016. It's it's it's about. 16 years old now. Maybe. 16 or 18 years old. It's about. You know, you know, the. The average. You know, utility bills.

Fine, thank you. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for asking. I'm just calling in regards to your online inquiry about a heat bump. Yes. And I wanted to find out exactly what is the heat bump. Is it something? Well, you tell me. Sure, it does both the heat and coolant. So you can use it both in summer for coolant and in winter for heat and. It has an outdoor lens. Is that one of the ones that go over the window? Do you have a door? Do you have a door? Do you have like a front house? No, I have a boiler. Okay.

I had a forgetful zoom end angle reduced source. So that's quite multiple surfaces three invoke minimum space. I finally learned a lot of some. I thought building and bombing of your coーン.

Okay. So what are you looking for? I'm looking to see because I'm at the time. We I only had, I only needed it in the three bedrooms. And now I wanted to see if possible to get a hold for having it. To put it this way. We've got two on the main floor and one upstairs. I have two bedrooms upstairs that need to be cool. And I also need the main floor downstairs to be cool. Sure. Okay. So you have like just one main floor and a top floor. That's the house. Yeah. Okay. So one bedroom upper floor and then the living space downstairs. Yeah, I have three bedroom upstairs, two with you in the unit. Okay, two of them. Okay. Yeah, and then the main floor. Sure.

And meanwhile, there is a consentive program available for heat pumps. Have you heard of that? No. Not at all. No worries. It's basically through Greeners' home, like a federal program. Is it called a fire? Yeah, Canada Greeners' home. It's a little spicy, sorry. No worries. So if you qualify, they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump in your home at 0% interest rate. So whatever is the price, you'll give the same money from government at 0% interest. And you give this interest free money for a period of 10 years. Oh, wow, that's awesome. Yeah, so you can discuss that as well. And then you can see if it's something you want to take advantage of as well. Okay. Okay, sounds good. Awesome. Tell me a bit about your home, like a windowset built, like what you... Oh my gosh.

I'm just about to send you the, I'm going to email you the agreement. Okay. Let me just make sure everything's in here and I also applied the discount. Oh, just one quick thing. I, we also include the audit, like both the audit, the pre and the post fee on the agreement. Because the government, when we submit the invoice, they prefer to see everything on one invoice. So I have included the audit, which will deal with the auditor directly, the 700. Okay. Hi. That's 700 is for both audits, right? It's for both audits. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's for your pre and your post. Okay. Okay. And then I gave you the extra discount because you're doing it up front. And I included the energy pressure. Okay, I'm sending it over to you now. I just let me know once you receive it in your email. Okay. So. Weaver eco home. I got it. And digital signature required. Yeah. So we'll just ask you to, I believe, start signing and then proceed to document to open it up. So you want me to sign even without reading one of my slides my life away or something. I'm so sorry you cut out there. Can you repeat that? You just want me to sign these documents, right? Yeah. So if you open it up, I can walk you. I can walk you guys through it. Okay. So. Okay. So I see some numbers. And it says 72, 15. The balance. Yeah. Let me open it up here on my end and I can show you. There's a breakdown on the top. Yeah, I see that you're in it. And you're on the first page. So the breakdown on the top, you'll see it's the full 2 1 1 2 1 half ton heat pump system. The clone and the outdoor unit. So I've included the thermostat, the energy pressure, and then you see the full home energy audit, right? Yes. So the 61 28. That was the, that was the heat pump, the 64 50, but I gave 5% off. So I brought it down to 61 28. And then I included the audit, which covers your pre and your post audit because the government needs everything on one invoice. Okay. So when you go down to the total all in with the audit, it's 68 28 plus a plus a just and then the grand total 77 15 64. And then of course, after the $500 security deposit, which we'll do after it's total amount is 72 15 64. Okay. So how much time do we have to pay this? If you're going up. Oh, no, no, no, you don't pay it right now. So all we require right now is the deposit of $500. And then after this full installation is completed and they'll completed in one day. I mean, our guys are amazing at what they do after the install has been completed. And then we'll take the remainder after the security deposit. Okay. So what do you want me to do now? Side. So if you're still on the first page, if you go down to the bottom left hand side, you'll see a signature field and where you can type in your name. Yes. Signature. I agree. Okay. Okay. Next. Okay. That's finished. Yeah. Once you see the green finish button, you just click on finish and it should allow you to complete it. Yes. And now I have option to download it or print it for email. Yeah. If you want to do whatever, if you want to download a copy on your computer, you're going to get a copy email key right away as well. So you guys will have a copy of that sent to you shortly. Okay. Now just bear with me a moment, Sam, that I do need to... So how we do the deposit is instead of taking the credit card information on the agreement, we have a secure system, a security link system that I'm going to send you, that way you can input it yourself without having to share your credit card information. Okay. So just bear with me a moment here. My system is a little slow today. Okay. Holy. I have a document purchase agreement. You received it? Yes. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. So you can... I would say maybe say, we're sorry that. And then you can also download a copy. So you guys have it on... Save on your computer. Okay. Because that invoice is very important because that's for the... That's going to be for the loan as well, but we have a copy on our end. So just in case. Okay. So now I'm going to try to send you... here we go. Okay. Okay. I need your credit card. $500 security deposit. Yeah. And it's good we're doing this now because what I'm going to do... Meta is... I'm actually trying to reach over to the team right now. Because you guys are in need of a... of a UC system ASAP. I'm trying to see if we can coordinate the audit and install, you know, as soon as possible for you guys. Yes, please. Yeah. I know today... because the last couple of days has been super hot. So I get it. Okay. So... I just make sure that that is... Can we tell the right email? Okay. I'm going to send it. So I just... I emailed you the... like the security link. Just let me know if you received that there. Yes. Very low. Oh, you got it. Perfect. So that one's pretty easy. You just open it up and then you can input your information. First name. This is my wife's coach. Should I put her name or mine? No, if it's under your wife's name, you can just put whatever is under. So put her name there. So... Card the bear. So... So we... Postal card. Okay. Okay. Your payment is confirmed. Okay. Okay. Let me just refresh my page. And then we're all set here. Yeah. It's completed. Okay. Perfect. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to... I'm going to forward it over to them right now. And they're going to be in touch with you guys. If not today, they'll probably give you a show first thing tomorrow. Okay. And they'll confirm. So they're trying to get the audit for the second and then the install basically as soon as possible. That way you guys have a AC system or some cooling. And then what will happen? Because we're... I mean, because the first thing first is the audit. But because we're going to get the work done, our team is... Our other team, our operations team is also going to be in touch with you to walk you guys through step by step on the loan process. So there are a few documents that they... That the government, of course, requires, right? Okay. So our operations team will be in touch to let you know all of the documents that are required. And then they'll help you... They'll help walk you through how to set up the online account through the... Through the CRA, the government website. And basically how to do the application process, you know, set by step. And in the meantime, in the meantime, if you can kindly send me... This is my direct line, by the way. So if you want to email me or text me whatever you guys prefer. But we usually ask for one picture of your panel box. And then a picture of your furnace, if possible. You want me to do it now? If you... Yeah, the sooner you can do it, because what we usually do is be forwarded over to the team, the technicians. Just so they can have a quick look, see what your current system is, make sure they have all the materials when they come for the install. Okay. So you want me now to go downstairs and take a picture of a panel and first. Yeah, if you can take like two different angles of the furnace and then one picture of your panel. And then what you can do is you can either email me. I'm going to email you once I get off this call, so you can reply back to my email. Or you can text me on this number, whatever is easier. Okay, I'll text you on this number. Yeah, okay. Okay, so... Do you want to stay with me while I go and do this? I don't know. Yeah, it's up to you whatever you're comfortable with. I might not have access downstairs with the phone. I'm going to email it to you. Sure, sure. Email it over. I'm going to send you an email right now. And while you're doing that, I'm going to go quickly speak to the team so we can try to organize and book the audit in the install as soon as possible. Okay. Okay, so I'll go do that now. I'll shoot you an email. If you need to reach me, this is my direct link in the call anytime. Otherwise, our dispatch team will be in touch with you very soon to also confirm the audit and install with you guys as well. Okay. Okay, thanks so much for your time, and I will talk to you soon.

I saw you putting in Korea on our Facebook ads for a heat bump. Yes, right. Well, you're advertising also rebates or something from the government. Is that right? The remix, there is an kind of like, an Enbridge grant, but there are only for like, an Enbridge clients. It's got to come up on June. We're not exactly sure what date, but it's only for an Enbridge users, like people who use Enbridge gas. So you have an Enbridge for you. Yeah, I do. Oh, you do. Okay, good. So, yeah, the ad says, can you like, do you like recall exactly what the ad was saying or no? I don't know. I couldn't tell you, but it was something about rebates. So, I hope to find brand or something. Okay, sure. The rebates are, as I said, only for Enbridge users. And it's kind of like based on the ton of a heat bump, like for every half ton, there is 250, 250 crap. So for two ton, it's going to be only 500 grand. So two ton, okay. Let me see, because I actually had another company just come and give me a quote. So 18,000 BTU. I don't know what, so yeah, I don't have a ton on there. I've got 22 seared duckless heat pump multi-port 18,000 16 seared duckless sealed indoor unit 12,000 23 seared duckless high efficiency multi-zone for 9,000. So, what does that mean? It doesn't say any tons. How I see. But do you have like duck work in your home? Do you have a furnace or now? Yeah, we do. Okay. Did they quote you on something duckless? Did I? I think I have a half of my house is not ducked. I have a large house, so half of it is boiler and half of it is forest air. Okay. All right. So you're looking to like get duckless units only for that specific area, which has my duck work. Okay. So how many heads you're actually looking into? I think four. Okay. Well, it's not the heads or not. That's not how they, I'm kind of confused. Does somebody planning on coming out? I think I made an appointment for Tuesday. What are your company? Well, I made a company with some, I mean an appointment with somebody that's coming out on Tuesday. And it was from Facebook, so I assumed it was you guys. Oh, no, it wasn't us because I'm like the appointment with her for the company. So I'm like, I haven't talked to you before. Oh, okay. We do like virtual meeting like Google meets, in which we provide it with the co-tons because the whole process. And if you like it, then we'd be the next step in person. But that's like an easy problem. Yeah. Okay. So what do they give me here? It's not, it's not heads. It's a unit in the attic that there's only one head inside. Okay. Because you're talking about the unit that is a wall right? Yes. Yeah. No, there's only one of those. But you know what? As far as the rebates are concerned, they have like a specific kind of like qualification. Like if you want to put like dockless heat pump like the heads, the one that's mounted there, well, you need to have them like one per floor in order to qualify for a rebate. Did you know about this? No, but there is one. There is one, there's just one for you. One for four. So there is one in the master bedroom. And then the other ones just have what is it called? I don't know. I just used the long rope here. So yeah, there's different, like it's just like a duck in a way that's in a room ceiling. Anyway, I don't really have time for this now. I was just going out the door. I'm leaving out of country. So if you want to book something or you want to call, give me a call next week, Tuesday, can we get that shopping up?

So you heard from Amy and she's asking for a five-digit code. Yeah, I have no idea what that means. Okay. So what they're telling us is when we sign in for your Lennox, it won't allow us because you haven't actually registered it. So what it says. Okay. So it says when you go on your screen of your Lennox, are you at home right now? Yeah. Okay. It says when you go on the screen, does it say select generate pin at the bottom of the screen? Let me just go because I am on the cell phone so I'll go to the thermal care. Perfect. Because all I'm doing is I'm just looking it up online to see how to do it because we don't use a lot of Lennox. So we're not that familiar with them, but it does say when we go in that it wants a five-digit unique pin number will appear. Now, maybe I see that. So telling me on your screen at the bottom of the screen, like if you go to when you go to install. I'm not there. See what my main screen is. Is there a settings button? There is a button. Then you okay. Are they settings? Yes. Okay. Got a setting seat that says anywhere to. It says generate pin. This is the second Wi-Fi away current temperature and humidity notifications devices. Add device. It says add device. That's all it says. No, but that's not right. I'm not. It says under just a system. So it means I'm the district. So when we go in, like if you go online and you type it in, it tells us it wants a five-digit pin, which is. Is the number that it gives you? Should I try to go on a bad setting? I do not know. No, I don't know. Give me one second. I'm just looking at this site. Let me go back into Linux log in. I put your email. Okay. I'm going to get out. I can't even get out from here. I can't even get in. So now you can't even get in. No, I said that day. He was saying something about five-digit pin. And he says, oh, no, no, no, I don't need it. Yeah. You need to put the pin. That's how you're registered for us to be or anybody to be able to. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I can give you the number. You can't find your five-digit code. It's not on the box or anything. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. How to find my pin for my Linux thermostat. Go to menu. Okay. Okay. And then go to user account. User settings. There's no user account. I see notifications user settings, display settings, a Linux dealer support access, I can use reader and set accounts for reading and. Thank you for B here, Ben, and Serial fan and setting. What do you use?يف. Okay. At the bottom does it say select generate pin. Nope. Right at the bottom of the screen. No. At the bottom you say log out or delete account. No. I don't want you to do that. Okay. Because it says go to menu, user account, then go to account and select generate pin at the bottom of the screen. You can use it account. But see, doesn't give me that option what you are saying. It just gives me first name, last name, phone number, change password, change email, face ID and legal. And then it says log out or delete account. Okay. Okay. I can go to the term with that because I am on the phone right now. I can try to go to the term with that is the second. You're not on the thermostat right now. No. No. No. Okay. So, second phone. Yeah. Yeah. You got to go to the thermostat. I'm thermostat. Now, let me see the in the menu, user account. Okay. You're going to go to user account and then go to account. Account. Yes. Account. I think you wish to dissociate this thermostat from your Linux user. Please have. Move out. No. It has email. You're thermostat is registered with your user account. You say it is registered with your user account. Okay. So, at the bottom of the screen, does it show select generate pen? Because when we go on to the Linux to sign in, it wants to find digit code. So, you can use the account notifications, schedules, pen settings, dealer support access, display settings. Now, see, I don't get that. Well, I go into the menu. I go into a user account. And all it gives me, like under like on the left side, it says alerts and reports, hoping for help and support tutorials. Okay. When you go to user account, is there a spot that you can select account again, like another account, like account or no? You just say account and then, okay, it says email is formula alarm and email.com. I can press that and see what happens. Well, it doesn't say to do that. It just says at the bottom of the screen, it should say generate pen. No, I don't have it. You don't have it. Okay. So, I can give them a call, I believe, and then at least they can help you. And then, once you get that pen, then we can help you from here. Okay. Give me the phone number. Okay. So, it's one. 800. 953. 6669. Any option? I doesn't tell me on here. It just gives me that number. I don't know if you can go to technical support, but, um, yeah, how do I find my pen for my Linux thermostat? I'm just going to miss that home screen, go to menu, user account, then account, and then it says select your pen at the bottom of the screen. Yeah. Exactly. I thought the white find out. I'll find the system. Yeah. They would be able to see we're not Linux, right? So, I can't. I can only guide you to a certain point. Okay. Yeah. So, if you give them a call, when you get that five digit code, give us a call, then we can monitor it from here. Yeah. See, even the day like today, when the template is outside is, uh, I don't know what the template is outside is. It will not go below twenty two point five. Right. Okay. So, something's going on, but we have to see what's going on. Okay. Yes. And then just either call me or text, same the number, and then we can look at it and have our text, our text, to look at it for you from here. Okay.

20240523-125005_2208_+19057011372_Outgoing_Auto_2198021573043.mp3," Hello. Hi, they're good to see you. My name is Nick Adonifer. This is she. Hi, Adonifer. This is Mariam calling from Wee Reacle home. Just calling you because we received an inquiry that you had interest in a heat pump. Well, I wanted to get more information. Yeah, for sure. So what we do is we'll book you in for virtual appointment with one of our advisors and then that way they'll go over all the details. Just to let you know there have been some changes in the market. So the government in the past was offering rebates, but they have transitioned that over to the funding program at 0% interest for 10 years. Have you heard of that? Well, yes, no. I wasn't clear on whether that was still available as well. Okay. So my thing is very simple. My understanding is that you need to do that first before you can hire a contractor to do the work, correct? Like as far as the application goes? Yeah. Like the applications alone has to be all approved. I'm definitely looking at a loan. I'm not looking to just buy this out right now. So that would be a component of whatever I do. So my understanding is that you need to do the application for the loan first in order for you to then go with a heat pump. But what I didn't know was, is there still a pre-evaluation requirement to be done or no for the loan? You do need to get an energy audit done. Okay. So we're like we're licensed and you know across all of our Ontario not just for providing heat pumps, but we work with most of the major auditing companies. Okay. As well as the whole government process. So what I can do, Jennifer, I can book in for like it's a free consultation or free appointment with advisor will go through basically the process and all the information because we all help with all of the steps for the application as well. Right. Okay. And they have only extended it for a short period of time because they have advised us that they are going to be closing out that program soon as well. Okay. So what I can do, I just have to gather just some details regarding the home. Are you what's your current like heating source right now? Propane. Propane. Okay. When you think because the whole oil thing, I understand that they're doing that program with oil. I'm going to talk to the oil. This is propane and this like my protein is just out of control how much I spend in this house. Yeah. No, I hear you. Okay. So how old are your furnace? My furnace is only a couple years old now. Okay. It's not too bad. And what's the proximate square footage of the home? It's probably around 2500, 2600. Okay. 600. Okay. Okay. Okay. And three. How old was the furnace again? About two years old. Three. Three. Okay. Yeah. So just make the press that there. And then 2600 square feet. And I'm assuming you're the homeowner and this is your primary residence? Yes. Perfect. And I don't have an address here on file. What's your address? It's 65049, Marshagan, which is M-A-R-S-H-A-G-A-N, Road. And that's Wayne Fleet. Although Mali Address comes in as Dunville. Dunville. Okay. Yeah, but we live in the County of Wayne Fleet. Okay. And N1A-2W-2. 2W-2. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then let me just see if there's anything else that we... Oh, what's your average? What would you say the average propane bill is especially in the winter time? You mean how much do I... Like, are you asking me like each time I fill it? Or are you talking about... Yeah. It costs me about 1,200 probably to fill it? 1,200, okay. And I guess on average when I do with people on propane or oil, it obviously depends on the winter. But then you wear between at least three, four times, you guys fill it? Or... It's about three times... Yeah, I'd say three to four times for the year, depending on how it goes. Yeah. Okay. That we are on propane for other things during the year. Right. Okay. That makes sense. And then what's the proximate... Or sorry, you said 2,600 square feet. Is it a two-story polluted patch? Yeah. It's a two-story with a walk-up attic. Okay. Perfect. Okay, perfect. So I think that's the main things that we're gathering on the home here. So what I'll do, Jennifer, now we... I can book you in with the advisor. We do it through... It's a virtual meeting. So it would be done through Google meets kind of similar to like a Zoom. Right. And... And try that. Well, it will work, but I can try it. You live in a little nowhere and our internet service is pretty awful. Okay. Yeah, but I mean we can certainly try. Yeah, we can try. Worst case, the advisor will give you a call and we can either try to help you get on or if you're having internet connection, then we can try to do the over-the-phone. Right. But I just want to confirm I have your email address here as undercoat of snow altogether at gmail.com. Yeah, that's correct. Okay, so that's what we'll be emailing it to. Yeah. And then... So let me look at the schedule here. And let's see what availability there is. Okay. I do have availability tomorrow at one o'clock. What's Friday? Yeah, I can probably do that, although next week is probably better. Or actually do you see there is one just opened up for today at 4pm. I don't know if that's too short notice. Yeah, four would be horrible. Let's just do the one at 1pm tomorrow. One at 1pm? Yeah. Okay, because my bus gets home at 4pm. Okay, gotcha. Okay, no worries. So I booked it in tomorrow at 1 o'clock. What will happen is you'll get a Google Meet, yeah, a link to your email address. And we usually give you a show in the morning, like one of our appointment bookers will give you a show to maybe tomorrow morning just to confirm. Right. Yeah, that would be fine. So what I would suggest is that, you know, I'll try to do the link. And if that doesn't work then you guys can just call me. So just so that we're clear, because at this point, like, I'm interested in quotes. Like, I'm not one of these people that just goes with one company and says, okay, that's what I want to do. So I'm looking at getting quotes from different companies. I assume that's not an issue with you guys. Yeah, yeah. So the advisor will go over like the package, the quotes, like they're the cost, but also importantly, the whole, like the incentive loan process, because it is, you know, there's certain requirements that we're clear. Yeah, a lot. So, yeah, so don't worry that that's the main thing. And the reason we do it, your Google Meet, just because they'll make kind of an analysis for your particular home and present it to you. Right. Okay. Just a couple other questions. Just, will I have you on the phone? And I mean, certainly they can go into more detail with me tomorrow. But so my understanding with the loan is that they can give a maximum up to 40,000, not that I'm not really looking for that, but that is my understanding. Is that correct? Yeah, so it's up to 40,000. And what, there's, cannot cover. I know that one is a heat pump, but is there any other things that can be covered on that? Because I do understand that you can make the application for the loan, and you can only do it one time. And then that will cover whatever. But if you're telling me that, you know, it's potentially closing as well, I just want to know what else it covers. Yeah, good question. So, main thing is heat pump, solar panels, windows and doors, water heater. Those are the main product stuff, great. Okay. And for the water heater, is there any requirement that that has to be on oil before or no? No, no, no. Okay. And can that, does that also include like tankless water heaters? Tankless water heaters are not for whatever reason, they're not part of the, are eligible. Okay. There is one water heater, which I can make a quick note of on the advisor to explain it to you. It's a heat pump water heater. Okay. It's the most efficient water heater out there, and of course it's a legible. So I can make a note of that Jennifer, then we'll go over like very quickly what the details are, the cost on that as well. Okay. And then you mentioned before you guys don't do the energy audit, but you have a list that you can provide, is that correct for auditors? We have, we work with most of the major auditing companies across Ontario, so we would be the ones who book like coordinating with the auditors directly. I think that's helping you through that. And again, the advisor will explain that to you tomorrow as well. Okay. All right. Do you have a rough cost on that? Because I know again, like those are independent, so there are different prices. The water heater? No, the audit. Oh, the audit is usually, like it's a general, for to cover both audits because you have to get to write your pre and your post. It's about 700 or 750. That cover is both audits. Okay. Because I know when I went on the website, I was actually on there last night, they have, I know I just love the government. I used to be a government worker, that's a sad part, but it's just crazy to me because when you go on there, for the loan and everything, it will tell you click this so you can get like these auditors, right, where you can go. But the only link that they have is to Enbridge. And Enbridge is doing them anymore. Yeah, exactly. Who do you go to? Yeah, it's tricky on the government website, especially because they've made so many changes recently. Yeah, they're not very helpful unless you're building a house and you have, like not building a house, but unless you have like a contractor, right? Yeah, it's not easy. It's just an individual person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's a good thing with us is we take care of that whole process. Right. Okay. We'll explain that to you tomorrow. And just very quickly, I do have to jump off because I have another appointment. What's the, what's the, what's the, of your home, like what's the year, sorry? I 1890. 1890. It's a mom. It's perfect. Yeah, I know where you need everything. Like, every. Yeah, yeah, I hear you. Okay. Awesome. So I have you booked in for tomorrow at one o'clock. You'll, you should receive the link shortly in your email and we'll give you a confirmation call tomorrow morning and posting it. Okay. You'll be updated tomorrow at one o'clock. Okay. Can I answer that for one other question before I go off just, it came to mind. With Windows indoors, if you're going to the loan process, do you have to replace like all your windows that are bad or can you just replace part? No, you can just replace part. Okay. Yeah. But, okay, so, you can just replace the one that is bad or it's not like that. Yeah, it's not like that. I can find out because we don't deal with Windows indoors. Right. Yeah, so you can also do the audit with it cover if you did Windows indoors through somebody else. Correct. Yeah. And we also hope with the whole application, like we have a whole department that walks you through the whole application process. Right. So we can help you with the application for other products even if we don't offer the product. Yeah, Windows is like, I'm sumbling with the whole window and door thing because I just hate that industry. It's like my pet peeve. They're just, they're so like out of control price mark and it's just so hard to get quotes without having to have like 50,000 million different groups coming in, which is just the nightmare. Yeah, I have got that. Okay. I do have to, I'm so sorry. Okay. No, that's fine. Thank you so much. Yeah, I'll leave the note and show over all of that with you. Okay. Sounds good. Thanks. Have a good night. Talk to you tomorrow.

20240523-132835_2207_+16477186300_Outgoing_Auto_2198036275043.mp3," Hello. Hello, my name is Tegan to the vendor. Yes. Hi, this is Hussna Collins from Weaver, Ika, home. I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Oh, one last. Hello. Yeah, hello. I will guide your inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Are you looking to get a hit bump in your own? Hit bump? No. Yes. Hit bump? No. No, hit bump. For sure, it's not there. Do you know what it is? What do you call a hit bump? I have no idea. Okay. It does like hidden and cool and it works both like an AC as well as a furnace. It's just like one product that does two jobs. And there is like an incentive program through jobs when available for a hit bump slow. What are you looking into? You can make a garden with it. If we wanted to have it like how much it's going to be cost. Well, it totally depends. It depends on the product as well as its core footage of your house. So what is this core footage? How big is the house? How big is the house? 1770s care for 1700s. 1700s? Yes. And what do you guys have right now? Do you have a furnace? Do you have an AC or no? What do you have? Old furnace and new AC. New AC and old furnace. Old furnace. So I see. Now, you know what? When you get a heat bump, it gets connected to the furnace. So you don't need to remove your furnace unless you have any issue with it. But the heat pump replaces the AC. So. Okay. Yeah. And how much it's going to be cost? It could range. Yeah. I can give you like a range that would be anywhere from 4500 to 6500. And. So, so, so, so, so. Here to be outside of the home. Yes, you will be outside of the home. Actually, heat and AC would be outside of the house. It has an outdoor unit that's going to be outside your home. And one indoor unit that's going to be inside, it gets connected to the furnace. And through the dock work, it's going to provide you with both heat and in winter and cool in and summer. So it does like two jobs like two things and one product just one outdoor one indoor unit. That's it. Okay. I can't. Okay. I can't. Okay. I can't. Okay. I can't. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You know IKA On the interior outside that is possible, no inside things. The inside is very tiny, it's just like a coil and it gets connected to the furnace. It's kind of like pretty small. How much is it going to take inside? How much is it? Yes. I have no idea. Honestly, I don't know. Like a box one, like a box. Yeah, you can, you know what? You can like to see it. You can just Google it. You can Google like indoor unit of a heat pump or coil of heat pumps. You can see the size of it. Because I can't like... Okay, okay. Yeah. But it's small, it's not like big. Oh, okay, okay. Pretty small. Yeah. Okay. And for incentives, you guys are going to apply it. We're going to go ahead with you guys. Oh, yeah. We take care of the paperwork, everything for the incentive. Do you know what the incentive is? As or no. No. Oh, I see. So what going to be incentive? Yeah, it's basically, there used to be like a rebate program, which ended on January this year. But for homeowners, home is down on the rebate. Government expanded an interest-free funding program. Like, if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home. Add zero-person interest. And you give this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. So for example, if the heat pump is going to cost you 5,000, government will give you that 5,000 without any interest. And you have a period of 10 years. Up to 10 years. Yes. Up to 10 years. Press free. And the good thing is, you can qualify for up to $40,000. You don't necessarily need to use all of it. But that's why you can qualify up to. So if you're looking to do any other upgrades in your home, like changing your windows or doing your, I don't know, water tank or anything else, you can use the money for as a well. So it's not just for heat pump. You can do multiple upgrades. It's up to you. Multiple upgrades. And after that, we have to return it in 10 years. We need to return it. In 10 years. Yeah. Okay. Without any interest. Without any interest. Exactly. Okay. Okay. Okay. And the bet is gone. They said the bet is gone in like. But you can. Okay. Government. So you know up to $40,000. That's the quality. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. I got that. It's are all upgrade in. I got that. Yeah. And it's up to me. God's will take the example. Can you did that. Yeah. Is there any possibility that anything. We would be there. a bit will be there, gonna be coming soon or any idea. Oh yeah, honestly speaking, we can't say exactly like when it's gonna be back. We can't tell that. But for Enbridge users, like people who have Enbridge gas, some incentives is coming back. But it's not gonna be the same way as it used to be. For example, before it was like 6000, right? The rebate. Now it's gonna be only for Enbridge and it's gonna be only 1500 or 2000 max. So it's not like the same way. It's gonna be like very small amount. Okay, but this program will be available for... Yeah, this program is available. Okay, okay. We will call you back. We need to talk about it. We are interested. We'll give you a call back. May I know your name please? My name is Hussna. Hussna? Yes. Okay, nice talking to you. We will call you. Okay, dear. Absolutely. Thank you.

20240523-140536_2207_+12266277577_Outgoing_Auto_2198050303043.mp3," Hello. Oh my speaking to my old. I'm asked is calling. Yeah, hi. This is Hussmo, Colin from Weaver, Eka home. I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Oh, so this is for the greener homes grant. So I'm just basically what I'm wondering is. As I understand it, if I'm eligible for the greener homes grants, then that subsidizes some of the cost of the heat pump it and from what I've seen on the government's website, they can subsidize an offset up to 75% of the cost of the heat pump. I see. Or for customers of integrity or hydro one that get some of their heating from electricity currently as part of the Ontario energy efficiency program. Is that kind of correct is like some of these things are ringing about. Well, there is like an. Not as like there used to be like a greener homes grant like a rebate, which actually ended on January this year. It never like was fresh that or never came up with something different. There is like another. They actually did the heat the heat pump grant it's called something else is called the affordable energy. For a area or something program. What is for oil do you have oil for us? No, I don't have an oil furnace, but I do understand that there was an incentive to transfer from oil to heat pump. That's so tough. It's so tough. Yeah. Party. That's what the one for oil is still available. That's called as a freeability program. That's only for oil users. But for other like. If I have like union gap and the only way that I keep my home normally is through like union gas, which is now called amber. Yeah. Is there anything that heat pump is due for customer of an average gas where it's like a normal residential unit? There is like an average rebate program that's coming up pretty soon like start of June first week. We just like had a meeting like a couple days ago with the auditors. So there is a rebate coming up for an average users. And I know you have one. But the thing is it's not like the same way as it used to be like if you remember we used to have a rebate of 6,500 for an average before right now. It's only up to 2000. Yeah, I do understand that it's because I believe the heat the heat pump from what I understand it can assist the what you're already getting from and bridge and it doesn't directly compete with average. Is that correct? What thing I didn't get it. So like for instance, if I were to be a customer that that got like one of the units of like a heat pump, for example, it's something that could supplement the usage that or you could select the usage from that heat pump and it would simply use more electricity. And then you would have a lower gas bill and a lot of people would like kind of be turning that way due to the federal carbon tax and fear and creeps and things like that, right. And my generally kind of feeling like that's where my demographic would be if I were to be a customer and like sign up for that. Yeah, but as I understand the benefits are quite a bit more skewed in the favor of people that are using like oil and like things that are a little bit more dated in terms of like getting things from like an average or like out in the country or farmers agriculture stuff like that. I see. But for Ember to, I'm not sure. I'm just wondering what your experience. Yeah, sure. As I mentioned for oil like people use an oil furnace they have an advantage because they get a rebate of 10,000 and that's still available. It's been like available since last year. They never ever. I know. But that's only for oil. Oh, you know what? You know what? Somebody else. How would I determine that? Yeah, we always do an audit like whenever for any incentive you ever want to apply you do an energy audit which is conducted by a licensed author and they do a whole inspection. They want to check this. They will check the furnace. They asked for the bills of how many leaders of oil were used and how much they actually paid for and that's also kind of very much based on the income. They have like a kind of like strict criteria for oil for ability program. I did actually have one of them over for like a it was similar but it was like their subcontractors out for like heating and cooling. So of course they're incentivized to come by and do the inspection. And generally it's like they'll hire contractors that would want to pass eligibility. They have that they have some strict criteria. Obviously, but. Yeah. If somebody's inviting them over to do the audit, usually they meet the eligibility criteria. And they're like, you know, you know, you got to read it and call the number and it's just like a you'd kind of have to be asking for it if you were to invite the auditor over and if you knew you weren't. Yeah, they have a specific charge as well. Yeah. So it's also another. Sorry, what's that? There's like another incentive program that's supposed to be the greener homes. That's called as the greener homes loan. That's an interest free loan program. Like you can qualify for up to $40,000, which is totally interest free and you have a period of ten years. You don't need to use all of that for decay, but that's what you can qualify up to. And there are many like not as I do believe that I tried something like that with this central like cooling for the second building is I have two buildings on this property. And there is an incentive to do things like solar and stuff like that. So I've talked to like solar and can a few places, but I'm just curious because I might be I might be out of my I might be out of my. Lead here in terms of like what I'm understanding because I've never heard the term oil like furnace before. So just it seems to me like a gas. So if I'm using like a gas furnace to keep my. It's just like a very building. That's the same thing as an oil furnace or that distinctly different because that's what it seems like. It's just like a bigger and size that furnace itself and it runs on oil like the fuel is oil. It's not like gas or propane. That's it. People using it like areas that have no gas to use oil. That's why. Okay. So it's something that's on something that's rather uncommon or like maybe more rural areas would be adopting to this or like pain core places that were slightly less developed through emberage or union gas. Yeah. Okay. So this isn't something that's for everyone and there'd be a specific demographic to target with this is it usually people out in the country and they have like those big tankers. Like who did they deal with that would be supplying oil based like heating or do they source it themselves. I see. Or I'm just wondering does emberage provide oil based services for people? I have no idea. Okay. Have you heard of any of the companies that are providing like an oil based service because he said the auditor comes and they'll check out your bills and make sure that you're getting what you're paying for type of things. But I'm just wondering who would be the source of an oil based service to your home. I'm just curious because they may have more information on like whether or not certain properties qualify that I might be interested in letting some friends with my know about and then contact you to have. You can contact the auditing companies like they're like auditing companies like if you Google them like close by your area, you can contact them and then they can arrange like an audit that's like the person that's going to come and check the whole house and the phone has everything. Yeah, I think honey electric would be our regional one and some like like I forget the other two but it's a. I think they subcontract like local like honey electric limited and I think like hydro one people can come down but generally want to get like a mom and talk shop that's in that city. Because they get incentives for that if they if they help local businesses and that's so it's like it's a pretty efficient way to sell trickle down but I'm just wondering how. In your experience i'm not sure exactly if if you had been doing this for a while or if you've seen a pattern over the years but I believe that this has been an effect for the last three years right for the oil pumps. Oh i've been like here for just a year now so I don't know just about the past like yeah how's going but what are you like looking for you're looking for a residential area or what. Well it's possible that i'm wrong and this is a rather new thing that's meant to directly combat the carbon tax in a minor way and just completely go away with some of the oil defendants that we still have in the region of so lesser Ontario so it feels like that so i'm not sure. If there's if there's been a thing and it's like you know when you learn a new word and you hear everybody saying it like the next day or whatever it's like i never heard the oil pump or like the oil company that would people be getting heating from their homes from so i was just curious to know like what company that was because I know there was just amberging and gas. And they don't really do a oil. No don't they don't yeah or what do you have in your home do you have like gas for us or oil for us. I do have a gas for us so I don't believe I'd be eligible for or what it would be that you'd be offering or being a liais on for unfortunately but i'm just still curious because I might be able to facilitate some other people to get. Fave themselves some money. But you're in all of it you're not interested to get a heap on for your place no well i'm just wondering. Like what would you say to somebody it's like if there's no benefit or if there's no eligibility what what's the main benefit of a heat pump that let's say that there's no government incentive and nothing to expect there. Is there still a benefit to having a heat pump when i'm getting gas from like you know ember to union gas and then my. So how much do you pay for your gas per month so what I pay for my gas per month as I believe anywhere from like. It was anywhere from like 68 to like 89 dollars but then since the federal carbon tax which I believe is monthly i'm not 100% but it's a monthly amount that almost doubles. Oh monthly I thought annually. If it was annually then that makes a lot more sense because I I looked at it and it was like I believe it was a 79 or like 100 what wasn't in your familiarity like it was like almost like a hundred bucks or something like that right. I guess so I don't know to be honest but I can look at it but it's like I was scared because I felt like it was i'm going to be a monthly thing because it was you know kind of like I would expect an annual thing to be like 300 bucks or something like that. But you know how he comes work and anything about them or no. I do know that it that it like reciprocates like heat energy it's like a vacuum of n type of thing right. So I know like same type of technology is like what an air fryer would use but much less severe obviously. Yeah exactly. It's nothing like that. It's kind of like the same technology that a refrigerator uses basically but a refrigerator it has a refrigerator only so it does only cool in and a heat bomb it has a refrigerator and the compressor. So that's both eating and clean so big different. Yeah back no and then pump the air because there's humidity in the air so how the condenser but just not like free free on or maybe ask for your own or whatever. But I believe that the most efficient use of it is heating in the winter from what I understand rather than cooling. Yeah it would do it only cool by like sucking or whatever and then the model of condenser would be the thing that would determine how cool your home gets from what I understand. The coolant is almost kind of like similar as the AC's like almost the same year value just a bit higher like two points higher than that of normal AC's. Yeah like a higher CPU first where in ship like you know. If the same size as an 80 it would cool a little bit more in the same area. That's what you would be on. It uses a refrigerant. Yeah it uses refrigerant. Yeah. Are the campaigns for like selling these and setting these up are they like more prevalent for winter time or like summertime. It's actually is this an effective cooling agent. The thing is the reason why they were not actually use like any here for for a reason is because of the like winter like Canadian winters right. The heat pumps are used to like work only to like zero Celsius minus five Celsius outside. So people wouldn't like change to a heat pump like they wouldn't get it. But now they actually came up with the like cold climate for Canadian winter. It works till like minus 25 Celsius. So that's the key. It was possibly like a battery problem or an inverter problem. I don't know. For like keeping it going because I do remember that there's like a there's new batteries that have rolled out that makes a lot that made a lot of things that weren't so Canadian friendly. Canadian friendly like I have a lucky bike that he can it can charge and like you know half an hour for and ride for eight hours now because these new canium nitride batteries. And I believe that like if one of those has one of those in it, then I'm sold. But are they also like are they also using like solar panels or anything like that like the company that you're representing. Are they just we don't do. Yeah, we do like the heat pumps at a consolation water tank air seal and dox. Like that. Because the same technology in a water tank would make sense. Yeah, they call it like heat pump water tanks. So they use the same technology as a heat pump thermodynamics. Is this on the website like greener greener homes dot CA or anything like that like what would be the website for I could research some of the stuff. You want to search about it? Like if you have a brochure of models that that you commonly recommend or like sell, I feel like I could probably figure out whether or not it would be for me. And then I could. Because like honestly, where am I right now without too many government incentives. I wouldn't be an ideal customer. But I'm just interested in what the future of this type of thing looks like because people wouldn't spend all of this type of money and infrastructure and if they didn't believe in it or if they didn't think it was going to be a widely adopted thing and so western Ontario. It's kind of looking at what the thing would be if I was to build a tiny home somewhere heat pump would probably work great. I'm sure I can send you brochure. Yeah, I have your email second send you one. Okay, that'd be that'd be awesome. And it's um so it's a course at live dot com, I believe is if that's what you have. Yeah, yeah, of course, that was my was Daniel Howard at Gmail dot com, but course at live dot com is less letters to type so. Okay, all right, I'll just send it to you to the live dot com one. Okay, okay, that's some. All right, then thank you, Miles. Okay, and thank you. Your name again. My name is husband. Your name is husband. Well, well, thanks. I appreciate you all. I hope you have a lovely day. Yes, well, thank you. Bye bye now.

20240523-112755_2208_+14166977418_Outgoing_Auto_2197992584043.mp3," Hello. Hi, good morning. My name is Hikim Adil. Yes, hi, Miriam. Hi, Jaya. How are you today? I'm alright. You're wondering if I've decided yet on the unit, right? Yeah, I just wanted to touch face with you because we were, I believe we were supposed to touch face last week, but I don't think I was able, I tried to give you a show. Sorry. We've been, we've been having like a lot of information. Our house is not like really that standard. It's an open concept with high ceiling. Yeah. So, um, if we're getting mixed information, whether or not like what kind of unit we want to be load and this and that. So, we're still at 36,000 BTUs. But, um, the unit. We're trying to figure out what kind of unit we want, like whether or not we want to. The, uh, the hyper heat, like the. Uh, the hyper heat. We're trying to figure out what kind of unit we want to be load. We're trying to figure out what kind of unit we want to be load and this is like really cool climate one. Because we're getting like baseboard heating anyway. So, we might go for one that's not. Uh, that's cool. So, that, you know, um. But I also want to know. So, the one that you quoted. Uh, I think that's the, like, so the cold climate ones are the only ones that qualify and only actually specific brands and models. Uh, the government won't qualify like just like a made or lower efficiency one. Uh, they're pretty strict with those rules. The only thing I would say about that, I'm like, I understand you guys are kind of deciding. The less efficient heat pumps are that they will only heat up efficiently in the winter time till about zero degrees. So, what will happen is you guys will be using your baseboard heating a lot more than the heat pump. And that's, you know, that's going to end up costing you guys like, you know, much, much more. Yeah, that's why I'm inclined to go to the cold climate heat pump. So, I'm in a little argument with my husband right now about it. The baseboard heating, uh, they say is just as, I mean, I deal with a lot of clients that are on baseboard heating. And the winter time, especially if you guys have cathedral ceilings, because there's a lot of heat loss of cathedral ceilings. Um, the average, uh, a hydro bill for a baseboard heating, uh, that I deal with is anywhere from depending on the size, uh, between 350 and 550 months. Um, so it's super, super high a baseboard heating is like super inefficient. It is, it's definitely good as an emergency backup. But as like a more of a primary heating source, you guys are going to spend a lot more money that way. Okay, so I have your price here. You're still, I mean, I'm still considering, um, the good money. Heat pump, cold climate heat pump. Yeah, it's been a very reputable brand and they're also approved from the government. If you guys did want to take advantage of the loans, uh, they are on the list of approval. Yeah. What, what was the square footage again? Um, it's a 25 by 30 foot, um, addition. And then let's be height of it is, um, like 26 feet. And then there's a, it's open concept, but there's also a top floor, right? So you have a, you have a, you have a 12 and a 24 head, so soon or no. So it would be, yeah, the largest head or unit is the 18,000. Yeah, and then like you have, so all, okay, okay. So we have to do 18, 18. Yeah, 18 and 18. Yeah, I would, I would suggest with the size and the, the biggest thing is because it's high ceiling or cathedral ceiling. Um, that's just natural. It doesn't matter how efficient the home or unit is. It's, it's always going to lose a little bit more heat loss. Um, it's a nature of that kind of build. Um, so I would, based on the size and that, I would definitely go with the 36,000 BTU. Yeah, yeah. Pretty. We've calculated that. Um, and it's definitely that's the one that we need. Yeah. Is that, is the bottom section like, is there, is it a lot more, um, living area, let's say, than the top or is it even? Um, yeah, a lot more living area, the, the kitchen in the, and just the living room. Right. Um, above is my work space. Because what I would maybe recommend another option is you go with the, um, the three head system. Wait, does that add up? Oh, mom, let me just see. Yeah, so you can go with the three head system where there's two units on the bottom. Since there's more living area, that way the heat and cooling disperses much better. If that makes sense. And then one large one in the top floor. Right, right. Um, it's up to you. I mean, there's the units are very powerful, but, and I know it's an open concept, but just as far as efficiency and like really kind of evenly distributing the heat, especially. Um, I would, you know, I would say if there's room and space, uh, two units on the bottom and one on the top would be ideal. Yeah, it's the problem is it's the side that it would go on. There's like stairs, there's things in the way. Yeah. Uh, so it just, we couldn't fit three on that side. I don't think with ease. I see. Yeah, like, yeah. Okay, no worries. I mean, if it's the good thing is it's open concept regardless. And these units are especially the 18,000. I mean, they're super powerful. So. And, um, good news. Bought by. Diken. Yeah, right. Yeah. So it's pretty much. Sorry. Are they the same unit? Are they Glenn or? I mean, yeah, they're pretty much the same like the same almost the same parts. It's like it's pretty much, you know, the, the Diken is more expensive just because you're paying for the name. Um, but as far as the, uh, like the, the units itself, they're pretty much neck and neck. They're, they're slim, right? They're not too. Yeah, are they, are they square? Uh, they're, they're square, but they're like, well, they're like not like kind of rectangular. Like, so they're more slim than square. Yeah. Would you be able to give me the model number of it? Good then. Uh, I think I sent it. Let me pull up the email. Um, it just says. Did I send you the brochure? Let me see. Oh, maybe you did send it before. Yeah. So, I think that brochure has all the options. Um, because they're pretty much the same. It's just whether you go with the three heads of sim versus the two head kind of thing. Um, but I'm just looking at the brochure. So there's the single zone. Sorry. 21 series. So that's the, that's the, the make of it for the model. Yeah. Multi zone. And then. Right. Yeah. I got it. You got it here. Yeah. So that has all the, and it has all the specs and all the dots as well. Nice. Single zone. Single one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it would be 18 18. Uh, 18. Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean, we're coming close to deciding. So I'm sorry. I was taking so long, but. No, no worries. Is it, are you guys like still looking to take advantage of the incentive program? Or not necessarily. Not necessarily. No. Okay. Okay. Because that again, I mean, we, you could do the heat pump anytime. I would say that would be the more time sensitive thing if you want to secure in your application at least. Yeah. Cause at least that way we can, and even if we book the install like in a bit, at least, because it does take a bit of a process for the, for the incentive, the doing the audit, the application, et cetera, et cetera. Um, so at least that would secure it in. Do you want to maybe take the rest of the day to review the brochure and the option and then I can give you a show tomorrow if that works? Yeah. That would be good. Okay. And the morning time like around 10, 10 30s. Okay. To give you a call. Yeah. Yeah. 10 30 would be better. Yeah. 10 30. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Do you know, I will give you a show. If you have any questions, you can always email me or you can give me a call, I'm usually in the office. Tell about seven o'clock. Otherwise, yeah, I'll give you a call tomorrow morning around 10 30 or so. And then, you know, we can take the next steps from there. Okay. Thanks, very. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.

I'm inquiring as to when the rebase would be sent out. Is this the original door? Yes, it is. I'm just wondering. So you're asking when will the rebate check be delivered to your house? Yes, or sent in the mail, whatever. Right. I'm not exactly sure on that on the time frame for that. But what I do know is that put the three and two sodds have been approved for you. The energy advisor confirmed that your file was committed to the government and let's start a process from them. So I believe that the energy advisor would be the right person to ask that question. That's why, because usually neither the government nor the government auditor. They do not share this kind of information with us because we're contractors. They can only share that information with the homeowner. So if you're the home owner, I would recommend you contact them directly. I do what you will have to contact the government auditor. The person that came to your house who submitted your file. and they can be the right people to give you an answer on the timeline of when you're going to get the check. Would you add in a note a phone number? Sure, I can check that so you just give me a minute. Yep. Okay, I have it here. Do you have a pen and paper? I do. Perfect. So the number is 416. 416. Okay. 9000. 9000. Okay. 4186. 4186. That's right. 4186. So I dialed one before the 416. Yes, that wouldn't be necessary though. If you dial just the number that works as well. But if it's a issue, you can always dial one. Thank you. I got a question for you. Yes, please. Oh, can you be able to tell me the balance of what I owe or do I phone someone else? You can contact finance company that you have to loan with. Or I can actually look into the details if you just give me a minute. Sure. I'll just get back to you. What was that? I'm just going to place the call and hold and I'll get back to you as soon as I have the information. Sure. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I'll have the amortization table here and front of me and I see here that you've made five payments so far for 223 dollars in 19 cents each. Yeah. The last one was made on 14th May 2024. And after this payment, the total amount that is due is 26,471 dollars and 49 cents. So the last payment was this month to 15th May 14th. Now, what was the balance? The balance is 26,471.49. You say 26? Yes. 26,471.49. How did you get that? I got it here in front of me is 222. 23,500. That was the... How do you do 23,374? 23,500. Yeah, I could be wrong about that. Just give me one minute. Let me just double check that. Yeah. I'll place the call and hold for a minute and I'll just get back to you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for being online, Mr. Rajanul. No problem. So yes, I was just going through the details and I also spoke to my manager and they told me that the table that I was actually looking at was the general table that was found at the time the loan was signed. The exact amount that you owe finance it the company would be able to tell you because if you've made certain payments already. So whatever is owing to you would be that information only the finance company knows and we do not get records of your payments. So I can give you that's the number as well. What do you show? 25,500. Yes, it shows 23,373. But again, as I said, I cannot like this is a generic table of how the loan term should be but because this is an open loan and you can make payments more or less like it's not like it's a fixed payment. So whatever you paid so far and how much exactly do you owe that information is with the finance company? All right. Can you do me that number? Yes, absolutely. The number is eight eight eight. Oh, yes, exactly. I'm sorry. Eight eight eight eight eight five three six. Five three six okay. Three zero two five. So I dial one before that one before the eight eight eight. Yes, okay. And that's the finance company. That's correct. Yes. And they'll be able to tell me what I owe and everything right? Yes, because you're making the payments directly to them. The amount gets deducted by the finance company itself. So they have all the records. How much has already been paid and how much do you owe? Yeah, and they would be able to tell me if I say once at a bank and put money in, they will tell me when they will be taking that out. Yes, absolutely. Everything, everything about your loan, this, if you call this number, they can tell you everything. Well, I appreciate everything you've done for me. Thank you so much. All right, and you have a great day. You too, Mr. Dolby, have a good day. Thank you.

I saw you putting on a Facebook ad for a hit bump. Ah, yeah. Um, okay. Well, I'm just Colin Slaia-Nobus, some updates in the market. Previous rebate program. It has transmission. And as a moment, government is offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? I've heard some things about it, yes. Okay. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with what a third visor. She will discuss this program with you and go through numbers as well. Okay. Okay. Now, can you just tell me a bit about your home lake when was your house built? Um, I think 1972 was built. It's a bungalow or a two-story. It's like a bungalow. What's the house size and its creft feed like roughly? I think about 1800, 1900. Do you have a furnace in your home? Yep. It's a gas for them. We have a boiler system. Boiler is a gas, it runs on gas or electricity. Yes. Okay. It runs on gas. Okay. So no ductwork in the house, right? Yes, we do have ductwork because we have central air conditioner. Oh, you have central air conditioner. Oh, I see. But no furnace. Electric furnace, but we don't use it because we have the boiler system. Oh, I see. Now, as long as the heat pump is concerned, for your place, it could be a ductless heat pump or ducted. So as you don't use your furnace, I believe you should be going with ductless then, because it's like mini splat that gets mounted to the wall. Right. Have you heard about that? Or no? I have not. No. Is this for furnaces? So like there are two types of them. What is ducted? For a ducted heat pump, it gets connected to the furnace, right? And the other is ductless. Duckless heat pumps, it gets mounted to the wall like mini splat. Yeah. So I was actually inquiring because of we were looking at updating our air conditioner. Okay. Sure. Not our heating system. Sure. Now, the heat pumps, it does like those coolant and heat em. So you can use it like for coolant and summer. And you can use it for heat and it went her. So it's up to you. The good thing is, as far as the heat and part of this concern, you will be saving about 80% of your gas bill when you use the heat pump for heat and the summer. Sorry, it went her. And you will be using it for coolant and summer as well, because it does two jobs. Okay. Yeah. So is this your primary residence? Yes. And you already homeowner cracked? Correct.

En correo que nos tenemos aquí es R-A-R-T-2002-0-20 a Jim O'Daco. ¿Qué es eso? Ahí ya. Aquí tengo una información, hago el Home Con Fue, ese es tuyo. ¿Cuál es todo correo electrónico? En miro debe decir Alexander.b a Weaver e E.C. Home. No, no. Chequea les pama, a veces igual les pama a lo mejor. Ahí lo voy a hacer. Sí. Aquí lo tengo. Ok. Ahora? ¿Míces en límites? Bones, mira, si te hablas si yo me llamo. Me hago un bolo, un bolo, mi sis. Lo hago. ¿Qué veis? ¿Ya lo habéis? ¿Pomo hay que tener esto? Ahora, pusa. No, ahora está pendejado. No, no, no, le alequí. ¿A no entra? ¿Qué te sale? ¿No entra? No. ¿No? No, lo preteo a veces como dice, puse el instalativo y nada. Pero, él igual. ¿Qué te necesitas? Bueno, ahora hay ver, entonces, si no pude entrar, vamos a... Déjame... Me he d... estaba viendo la información y me dijeron que estaba buscando para un hip-hop. Para un hip-hop. ¿Y por qué dos de hip-hop? Eso es lo que te da la califación y el aire acondicionado, porque bien la nota que la era acondicionado. ¿Nada o se te rompió? No, el aire acondicionado, el aire es el azchica que tiene. ¿Ya que yo compré esta casa? Sí. El aire, el aire tenía un año y yo tengo 18 años de estar en esta casa. O sea, que estamos hablando que el aire tenía 19 años. Le dije la chica que el aire, que es la califación, la cambiarse entre años. Es nueva. Es aire fichon. Sí. Eso es lo que yo le decía. Yo lo que le dije es que le he tenido una continuación para el aire acondicionado. He ahí cocinado trabajo. Incluso lo tengo aprendido ahorita. Pero claro, a mí me gusta a UG y las cosas me teniendo. Entonces, por este es que me interesa los cambios que hay y las beneficios que hay el gobierno también. Por ejemplo, te he cambiado las ventanas en casa y el gobierno me dio una buen reveille. Me pareció que la situación era parecida con el aire acondicionado. El gobierno lo rive que yo dan no son de la era acondicionado son palojipams. Los hip-pump, por ejemplo, la función de hip-pump es lo mismo que el aire acondicionado, pero no solamente te da aire enfri o papelán, te da aire caliente para limpiarnos también. Y así todo tenga un hi-efficiency furnace de cuesta menos con hip-pump que con furnace. ¿Qué hago por la califacción en todo caso? No, la califación te queda con la furnace. Hip-pump, lo que va a hacer es que te lo va a dar, porque es más económico. Por ejemplo, ¿por qué pueden funcionar hasta menos 30? Si hay algún día que vaya por debajo de menos 30, el sistema automáticamente se te cambia para la furnace. Aha. Y entonces, por ejemplo, la opción que yo tengo son dos. El mirando. ¿Qué te escucho? ¿Se va a la comunicación? ¿Qué tamaño es esta maño a la casa? Mira, ¿de mi vida? Yo lo que sé es que esto se llama un búngalo. Tiene 4 cuartos arriba y dos cuartos abajo. Es un búngalo y bueno, la casa no es muy grande y mi tamaño pequeña, esta tamaño mediana. Yo creo que ese fue el problema cuando yo no pasé acá que el aire ha funcionado siempre igual. Me es un aire como el del que la carfe de mi hijo, que nosotros llegamos lo enciende y a los 10 minutos ya estamos todo fresco. Aquí tengo que parar alguna hora, dos horas para que me refresque la casa. Me plico. Entonces, creo que la situación de este aire no es lo suficiente, eficiente para la tamaño de la casa. El problema de este día es que compré la casa. Pero como se los obtras, ya estamos hablando de Julio y Agosto, que es el tiempo que tal ver verano, yo creo que hago es alimentarme como el aire, como el avanico para que me refresque el aire de la casa. Pero lo que es que se lo que sería mejor un high-he piscín, así como tengo la califacción de la califacción de dos molasos me calienta la casa. Claro. Pero eso no lo tengo con el aire congelado. Bueno, como es la situación con ustedes, ponen ese un aparatro nuevo, ¿me imagino? Sí. Porque yo tengo separado lo que es la Furnacell y el aire condicionado. Sí. Aunque ocupamos los mismos doctos y todo, pues uno es aire condicionado y el otro es califacción. Entonces, ¿te perne un aparatro? Y ese aparatro me sirve para las dos cosas, ¿no? Exactamente. Y va a estar conectado, la aparato va a estar conectado como el aire condicionado a la Furnace. Va a estar conectado el coil, va a estar por la Furnace. Sé que la Furnace. O sea que está conectado a Docwork de tu casa. Sí, sí. Me entiendo. Bueno, ¿y eso más o menos cuánto es el costo? El costo total viene siendo 585 o 85 con todo incluido. La instalación, el Ejipomp, la guarantía, te da un Smart Thermostat que deponemos la parepa que puedas controlar la temperatura. Todo incluido a finales, precio es 585. 585. 5,000 dólares. Perfecticamente. 5,000 dólares. Sí, más o menos 5,000. ¿Y qué es lo que te da el gobierno? ¿Ustedes ya tienen la rebaja del gobierno ahí? La rebaja del gobierno va a venir pa junio. Sí. Que la verana del gobierno, por ejemplo, va a ser... A lo mejor lo que te puedan ahorrar de eso va a ser reotro de los mil dólares. No, no. ¿Por qué tú hiciste una prueba de energía ante o no? No. No. Me llamaron, me llamó. Es que mira, el problema que estoy llamando mucha gente. Todo lo que tú sabes como esto. Si o eso. Si, ahora usted es lo localizado a veces de internet o a través del Facebook. Pero la gente es si te iba llamando. Aquí me llamó para esto, me llamó para el otro. Y entonces, no, cuando le dije a la gente te llamaba mí, de que vamos a pasar por su cara, que te granti, yo no creo ni nada. Es esto que le cosa que hay que hacer, y yo estoy muy ocupado, no lo puedo atender. Pero si me han llamado, me han llamado, también para el LG, para la compañía de esta que yo estoy, tengo contacto con mío, y lo mismo, lo he dicho que no que, que no me interesa. Déjame hacer una pregunta. ¿Cuándo fue que tú hiciste la ventana? ¿Hace cuánto fue que hiciste la ventana? La ventana, la ventana, el año pasado. ¿Y el año pasado cuando tú hiciste? ¿Tú tuviste que hacer el pagar por alguna auditoría de energía o no? No. Yo soy una conozca de jazz, yo me hicieron todo, me hicieron pre supuesto, me hicieron la redada que me iba a hacer y él es para que ellos. Ah, ya. No sé qué hablan hecho yo, y cuánto fue la redada que consiguieron. Yo por si hice con varias compañías que le salió más económica con esa mesle. No, claro, así es como debes la mentir en la pabra. Bueno, vamos a hacer una cosa. Yo tengo en venta, yo sé lo que es esto. Mira, a día de hoy, a día de junio lo tenemos a la huerte de la esquina, pero sería que es lo que se puede conseguir antes de, como tengo mi califación que está en una mesita y me trabaja las mil maravilla. Yo no tengo problema con la califación porque incluso tengo hasta una garantía extendida que esté pagando a energía. ¿Ves? Ah, bueno. Y el aire aconsejado con esto también te está trabajando. O sea, que digo lo que quiere cambiar lo por algo que me he leído en mi calma en 20 minutos. Yo vengo lo primero y paso, me he leído así como la califación. Porque como te digo, el aire está apasado por el dios deyer. Claro, se apaga y se enciende. Lógicamente lo mantengo a 22. Pero como te digo, pues ya sí que ha sido en 10 años ese año. Claro, si los ocupan los 20 años, los papos se le merecen por cada año, verán, lógicamente. Me lo veis, también tengo con el aire y un servicio. Si se me gobe el aire, también. O sea, yo estaba pensando que me voy a ahorraría todo esto, el servicio que esté pagando por el mantenimiento de el hielo y por el mantenimiento del aire de concienado. No de eso me va casi ochenta y con el rentado del tanque de agua, estoy pagando $86 al mensual. ¿Qué está pagando renta? ¿No? ¿Le aguantan y miento? ¿Qué parte pagó el mantenimiento y de renta del tanque? Ya. Y fue muy chensecido en lo que pagó el mes. Ve, pero lo que le pase a la califación, la verdad es que para hacerse un esto, nunca lo he usado. Y ya tengo como 5 años que me tenés esta garantía. Y nunca le he usado. Una vez en el ruino, el termotato y me lo hielo, me lo repararon y esto fue todo. ¿Sí? Así que porque nos esperamos en todo el segundo, a ver cuánto es lo que esto va a cortar. Y a ver qué podemos hacer. Yo lo que podemos hacer es yo te vas a saber, le voy a escribir aquí para cuando venga junio y ya tengamos todo en cuanto... Vamos a hacer esto. En cuanto yo tenga más información, en concluo de cuánto va a ser exacto, yo te llamo, porque si los números dan la cuenta, lo que podemos hacer es ya te podemos ya sacar un turno para junio para que sea el primero en la lista, para que no se te pase este ribay y lo puedas coger. Sí, te lo quedaste. ¿Vamos a hacer eso? Sí, perfecto. Bueno, quedamos así entonces. ¿No les voy? Vale, vale, está bien. Bueno, pues vale, mucho gusto. Vemos que yo tengo muchos clientes cubanos, pero cualquier cantidad de clientes cubanos, ¿eh? Yo entro... ¿Sí, eh? Yo entro algo y... ¿En qué... en qué dealership? Estoy aquí en Olmillo, la que está en Sanchez y Jim. Es un gran... Es uno de los maquilantes que tiene la cena amor aquí en la ciudad. Déjame escribirlo para... para saber porque...

You have reached the city of vancouver. Your call is now on hold waiting for the next available agent. The event cover. My name is Pam. How may this be? Hi Pam, good afternoon. I called you earlier regarding the door to door sales. I'll door you company. OK, so sorry to call you again. I just forgot to ask about the interim one is the policy license. So I just got this information from small business that is possible to get an interim municipality license. So we're looking to do the activity for at least six municipalities in BC. This is something that you can also help me with. Yeah, the interim municipal business license is just to allow construction or trades related businesses. So your category that you will be doing, which is the door to door, does not apply to the IMBL in term municipal business license. It's strictly for plumbers actively doing plumbing work, builders, contractors, gas installation, gas appliance installation, those type of trades. Oh yes, so our product, we're not just going to do sales, but we will do installations as well. So this is product and services. So our products are mainly air conditioning, heat pumps, air handling. So we have technicians that they have a gas license. OK, so you're looking at two separate business license then, the one for the door to door and then the other one. So yes, you would be eligible for the intraminist to pull business license. How that works is you first get your city of Vancouver contractor business license issued. I'm sorry, thank you. You first get your business license. And then I'm just going to check to see if on the application you can indicate you want the interim municipal as well. One moment please. OK. OK. Yeah, it looks like you'll have to do the two applications, the business license, regular business license. OK. And then a separate IMBL. I am the, this IMBL for, is this any sort of service? Yeah, so that is for the installation of the HVAC and heat pumps. And it will work across all the municipalities, right? No. OK. So there are six cities that participate in this thing. So the six cities actually came up with a licensing agreement. And the six cities, it is listed on the site. But I'll just mention it to you. It will be the city of Bernabé. OK. Delta, New West, Richmond, New West, Richmond. Third. OK. And of course, including Vancouver. SUREY. Yeah, Vancouver. OK. Bernabé, how about this cookie time? No, it's a good one. Obstboard. No. Um, so for the lower mainland, those cities I mentioned, I guess you could say they immediately surround the city of Vancouver. Cucutlum is, they're not part of it now. No, it's for Cucutlum. OK. Or North Vancouver. Abbotsford is what we would classify in the Fraser Valley. I believe that they have something similar. OK. Oh, did they have something? Yeah, there's something called the Fraser Valley Intermunicipal Business License. And it's for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 cities out in the Fraser Valley. OK. OK. So those cities came up with their own agreement. OK. And then if you want to apply for this IML, is this the same as I'm on the register for an account? Is this the same page that they need to register? OK, the same. Just I need to register twice for the door and then for this IML. And do you know the time frame from the time I applied until the license is issued? Minimum six weeks. Minimum six weeks. Now that being said for the contract, the HVAC, and that type of license, if there is a project that you have did on them that you have received, and you need those license right away, you can after the fact just send an correspondence to the department, letting them know that there is a need to have the license issued a bit sooner. As they will do this for the trades contractors. Oh, OK. So there's an option to expedite it. Yes. OK. Both for the generic business license and IML, right? Yeah. So you need the generic one first before they'll issue the IML. But yeah, they will be within a time frame of each. Right. OK. So I need to wait for the Minimum six weeks. And after six weeks, I will be able to apply for IML. But say, for example, I apply for business license in Vancouver. And then obviously, I can also do the trade work, the installation work, because I have that license in Vancouver. This will cover the, is that correct? Sorry, that's a question. OK. So it will be step one. You get your city of Vancouver business license issued. Yeah. Step two, you will get your IML issued. And one step one is issue. You can start doing work in city of Vancouver. Including the installation or the guys installation works. OK. OK. And then step two will enable you to work on the six other cities. Now remember, step one, you are applying for two different licenses. One is the contractor one. And one is the door to door one. OK. So for the business license, what is that contractor again? So I missed that door to door. And yeah, it's just a bit licenses. You will have to get one is for the actual installation of your product. So I'm looking for three licenses. Yeah. Now you're at three. Yeah. Right. OK. So business license, daughter door, second license in Vancouver, just the contractor. And then in or more that I am billed right after the IML. OK. So I need to get first the business license done after the, sorry, before I apply for the contractor one, right? Yeah, the IML one. No, what I mean, sorry, within, within Vancouver. Within Vancouver, yes. Yeah, yeah. OK. So I need to wait for my business license generic one before I apply for the contractor license. And I mean, once again, when you are applying through the portal, you want to make a note to the effect that I am also going to be applying for an IML so that whichever clerk is assigned to your application can hopefully do them side by side. Even though it's two separate applications, you have to put through. All right. OK. Right. OK. I'm officially asking. And vice versa. Like if somebody sees your IML first before they see your other one, they'll see your notes saying, I am also applying for my regular business license application at the same time. OK. So that IML will cover both the door to door and the contractor license. It will not. It will not. Your door to door is a total separate thing by itself. I mean, you could be selling oranges and your HVAC. But at the same time, but you will still need like a peddler license. It's not related to your contractor business at all. OK. It's like you got two business on the go. One is you're doing contracting work and the second is you're doing door to door. OK. Right. OK. Because the IML is only for trade, which is, you know, the gas installation. So that means I would need to get another separate license from each municipal before the door to door sales. Right. Exactly. Yep. Too much work. But I know. OK. Pa, would you go in to take down your name? So Brawler is going to look for you whenever I have questions for you. OK. My suggestion to help you is that each municipality, you might want to get a map out. And the lower mainline has their own website and contact. So instead of you having to call them all out, you might just want to do like, you know, send out an email to them. Or on their website, just search the word door to door sales or peddler or contractor license. OK. Peddler. Door to door sales. OK. Perfect. Yeah. All right, Pa. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. Our phones work in a very, very good way in that if I've spoken to you, it'll reroute the call to me. But if I'm on the phone, it'll go to someone else. Oh. And if that's why you called me now because you called me earlier and I spoke to you. So the system knows that you spoke to me. So the call comes through to me. But if I'm on a call or I'm not here, it'll go to someone else. OK. All right. That's fine. I'll look for you. I'll look for you. I know I know I know that's fine. OK. Thank you for that information.

I'm at work at 6. But I'll just log on to Google at that point, I guess. Can we make it on 7, actually? Usually we're done as 7. If we do 7, will you be able to make it 100%. I just want to make sure that if I'm staying behind both, because usually we wrap it up as 7, but honestly for you.

So, just in case a customer walks in, we might be interrupted, but I think that's 7, I should be free, basically. Perfect, yeah.

And I think you sent me the invite yesterday. You did, right? My colleague did. My colleague had booked our appointments. She did, yes. No problem. And we're discussing what the heat pump? Yes, I believe I said on the notes that you already got to approve for the loan. You were just pretty much gathering pricing and kind of like how long it was going to take, because you already did the outer, right? I did the pre-energy audit, right? Okay. And I got solar panels installed, right? Okay. So, I am getting that $5,000 rebate, but my energy auditor told me that because I did the pre-energy audit, so I qualified for the additional rebate as well. And because there was some new infusion of funds by the government. So, he said, like, why don't you look into getting a heat pump as well while you're at it? So, I said, why not? So, you're going to get a now, we're going to look at, keep bumping stall, and then, okay, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. So, I just want to see whether it's worth it, right? Because my air conditioner is just $7,000, right? The unit at my house is just $7,000, and I need a bigger unit too, right? Because it's a $4,000 square foot house with a finished basement. So, I guess I need a $4.5 down. I'm talking to you because right now there's no customers, right? This is not the customer that I... Yeah, yeah, not the customer. By the way, if I hear you've got it, I know that was because of a customer came. Okay, what I can do is I can do for the 5, like 4 to 5 down anyways. So, I'm going to give you a question on that. Because yeah, your house, I think, is about $4,000 square foot, right? It is. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. All right, and what about the air conditioner? So, the air conditioner essentially goes wasted after? Yeah, so, for the air conditioner, you can do two things. Because it's fairly new, you might... If you want to sell it, you could sell it on your own. If you want to dispose it, we could help you dispose it for you. But I'm pretty sure maybe you want to look into selling it, right? Okay, so basically essentially putting it in the market place or something like that, right? Exactly, yeah. And then somebody would come to my house and pick up the air conditioner from me. Would you be able to help me in that process though? For what we would do is we would uninstall it. And we can offer you the option of disposing it. But we don't handle anything in terms of selling it or anything like that, no. But if I'm selling it, like you went you uninstall it, then the person just has to come and pick it up, right? Yes. Or do they have to do anything else? No, they just have to come and pick it up. I think that would be pretty straightforward. And when we are talking about Chinese brands or are we talking about green or something from North America? The whole from the wolf that we have, the wolf from North America is BladeX, which was actually funded in Marcom. It's been three owned business for three years. They have done pretty well in terms of national in Canada. They have a little bit more climate, so they will go down to minus 30. The other one that we have is a little bit more premium, which is a little bit more expensive. The main difference between the two, to be honest with you, is one is just more known international and has a lot longer in the game. But the wolf is going to be the second one is going to be green or toss it. Green is the Chinese brand, right? In green media, they are both the biggest manufacturers and they are both Chinese. Okay. And they do have some five tons that qualify for the repaid, because I was told that they don't have five tons that took a qualify for the repaid, or like four and a half tons. We can do either four or four and a half. And they both qualify for the repaid, right? Yes, all of our brands and models that do qualify for the repaid, yes. So you're saying Bladex is the local one. Let me do some research on Bladex and Green. I know Green is a good brand, but it's a Chinese brand, right? So that's, and then what about the compatibility with my fullness? It shouldn't be an issue. As long as you probably have a fairer, like bigger furnace, how many BTUs is your furnace? I think my furnace is not big as well. What I looked at was it's around 60,000 or 80,000, whereas it should be around 120,000. Got it, because one thing that I can do say though is that my technicians would always do an assessment. And if they go over, for example, and they feel like the size of the heap on the few big for the furnace, the most likely the chance of them not installing it is going to be very big. So, because you said your furnace is 80,000 BTU? I think it is. I can check it out. I don't remember it now, but I think it's around that. Sounds good. How do you calculate the BTU? There is some way to calculate this, right? Or is it on the panel inside? It's written over there. It should be in the furnace, yeah. Yeah, so maybe when we talk, like we can, you know, I can go check that as well, but I think it's less than 100,000 for sure, because I wanted a 100,000 one. But it's installed by the builder, right? It's seven years old. And it can be 60,000. So it has to be an 80,000. Yeah, it should be bigger than 60,000. Yeah, so I guess it's around that. But how do you qualify that? Like whether it's going to be compatible with the heap pump and all the stuff? It's going to be depending on the sizing of the pretty much the coil. Right. And when would you be making those assessments, basically? Because I need to know of it because June 7th is when I have scheduled the post assessment, the post energy audit, actually. Okay. Right. So we can do that. Assessment and installation here. Let me double check your address where it was at Brampton. Okay. You're very close to us. You know, if everything looks good on paper and we get agreement and the deposit down, what we would do is we would say we continue somebody over as soon as possible. How much am I looking at? Here, let me take a look. The five ton, you're looking at, so R3. The two options that we have is three and a half and four or four and a half. You're looking at after taxes, 70, A53. And that's which model? That's for the Bladex. Okay. And the agree? The agree after taxes is going to be about 11,017. So it's about roughly $4,000 more. So we're going to have $3,000 in a little bit. Let's talk about it. And I'll talk to you at seven then. In the meantime, I'm going to look at Bladex and see what they are. All right. Thank you then.

You put an inquiry on Facebook ad for a heat bump. I'm calling to lay know about some updates in the market. The previous Weaver program has transitioned. The government is now offering funds at a 0% interest rate. Did you know about this before? No. I can start up an online consultation with one of our advisors. She will discuss this program with you and go to her numbers as well. How much do you get to get the rebate? The rebate program has ended on January this year. The rebate program has been approved for homeowners. The government extended the interest free fund. If you qualify, the government will give you the money to get a heat bump. That is exactly what the advisor is going to lay. I'm going to ask you to get the money back. Tell me about your home like when was your house built? How new? I just moved in last week. The house was just built like last week. The house should be at least six months old otherwise it doesn't qualify. That one I just get the last week's heat.

20240522-161434_+14168826025_Incoming_Auto_2197873601043.mp3," This call is being recorded. So, good afternoon. Can anyone choice home services? How may I help you today? Good afternoon. How are you? Good, good, good. Thank you, how are you? Good, good. Yesterday, one of your associates told me about the feed pump or anything. It's a free feed pump or something. I know it's not a feed antenna. Would you claim me like a bus to a procedure for the feed pump or is butter pump too? Sure. So, as far as the heat pumps are concerned, there are programs from the government. So, before there was a rebate program running from the government that was a rebate of up to $7,000 for the heat pump. Obviously, like you said, nothing is for free, but it's the marketing. How it's free, actually, so, but this rebate program for $7,000 that ended on 5th of January. What rebate? Your January, if I'm not wrong. Yeah. So, right now, there is another 0% interest program that's running. And in addition to that, it really depends on what your system is right now. And your bills and your annual income. So, if you're making, to be honest, if you're making a lot of money, then you wouldn't qualify for the programs. But if you're not making a lot of money, and in addition to that, your bills are high. If you are paying, let's say, $50 for hydro and $70 for gas a month, then it wouldn't make any difference. But let's say if your utility bills are anything between $200 to $250, maybe $300 a month, then it would definitely make a big difference. And it would help you with a savings program on your bills as well as there is a bills rebate from the government that's running as a moment as well. And in addition to that, the heat pump itself, it's up to $7,000 more energy efficient than conventional furnace and AC. So, our advisor would do the math obviously, they're the experts. I'm only the call center agent. They do the math and the calculation for you and show you how it works and how it is. And obviously from there on, it's up to you. If you like it, if you think that it's something for you, you can go ahead with it. If you don't like it, you don't like it. No obligations attached. Yeah. But there is no rebate anymore, right? The rebate itself is not there anymore, correct? Yeah. There is another program from the government, which is zero percent interest. And another program which helps with utility bills. So these are the two programs that government introduced after the end of the rebate. Yeah. Yeah. I understand the help with the utility, which I mean, of course, if you're having the higher efficiency water pump, you already usually tell the world, they come down right, but the government not putting anything else, right? No, there is a bill rebate. So that is their as well. When it's high efficiency, you will be, I mean, your bills will go down. That's their as well. But in addition to that, if you're moving from less efficient equipment to energy efficient equipment, there is a build rebate. So let's say if your bill is $100 a month, I think the rebate is up to 30 percent. It depends on homeowners. Most of the homeowners qualify for between 20 to 25 percent. And what actually happens is there is an income condition to raise. Absolutely. I have to be, I have to be go through that program. So here I can start those program. Then I really call you back. So you mean that you want to look at up, correct? So you can, so you can Google look it up. The government zero percent loan program for heat pumps. That's zero percent loan program from the government that you can look into. There are many programs as such from the government, but this one is. Poreclery for heat pumps. And it requires an audit as well and energy audit, which you do. But then the government pays you back. So you do the energy audit for I don't know, $7800. And then the government pays you back that $7800 right away. So I go through the audit. So with that, and you can also look up build rebates on tarry or utility build rebates. And you can look into the details, the income detail and everything and find out if you can actually qualify or not. And if you need our help, you can give us a call and I can or wherever you get connected to will. Book you for an appointment with one of our advisors to help you assist. So I will definitely do that one first. Let me find out the details and everything. Action for the program. I respect you are honesty and do try to tell me what is what's going on. I have like little with awareness going on because I knew what I was just want to be installed heat pump before. And we ate it, but it's too late now. I couldn't right that time. It was truly free. So you would install it for $7800 and then the government would pay you back that amount. I know I understand that program. I couldn't fix also. I am late now. I just go through this one. Maybe such kind of evening coming back and no idea yet. Right. You never know with the government. Absolutely. It may come back. It may not come back. We hope that it comes back to the poor and poor homeowners have the opportunity again. But yeah, fingers crossed. Thank you very much. I have you. I have you. I have you address and all kinds of. So in case I make mine to do that one I call you back. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Have a good day.

The reason for the call is we got an inquiry through Facebook about a heat pump. Oh, is it a heat pump? I'm sorry, I was inquiring about air conditioning in my house. Yes, so heat pump is kind of like an air conditioner and a heating as well. Because were you looking for like an AC for the home? Just AC, yes. Because what do you have for the winter? Do you have a furnace? Yeah, we do. How old is your furnace? It's pretty new, actually. They got it last year. Oh, that's pretty good, which means that is probably high efficiency, right? Let me ask you one thing, because I don't mind if it's usually for heat pumps, we do meetings, but for AC, I can just tell you the price pretty much like upfront. How big is your home? It's two floors and it's attached to another house. Okay. Yeah, like it has a basement and like the three bedrooms are upstairs and then yeah. Do you know, size wise, like square footage? Roughly, doesn't have to be exact, but roughly. I have no idea to be honest. That's okay, that's okay. Are you Spanish by any chance? Yeah. Where? In Ecuador. Ecuador, much better. I know, I know. Oh, I'm sorry. So what happened to AC? Did you break your feet or not? No, I've never had a plan. I think that house, we were there with the old house. And it wasn't that well-conditioned. And what kind of furnace are the ones that were supposed to be put in an electric or a gas? Electric, I think, it doesn't have gas. It doesn't have gas? It does. And then your house, your house, it has the dockwork. What is that? That's the best thing about the channel, that the air in the house is distributed by the two of you. Yes, there are about a few square meters, so it's in between the heat, right? And we're going to have a little idea if it's pricey, because I would have to look for a pricey price at the cost of size. But how much more or less, don't you like to start? Do you know how far they are? Are they in Toronto or what if they are? No, we're in Berlin. In Berlin. Let me see how far they are. Do you have the direction there, more or less, to go to the house? Yes, the house is 63. How does that sound? It's like C-A-U-C-E-R-E. Present. Present? Emberry. Do you know how far they are from us? I can't believe you're in the house this morning. I can't wait to see this. Sorry for the bad words. Was that 63? Yes. Let me check here quickly. How long have you been there? In July. It's been a year. Well, in July. In July, it's been a year, barely. How do you like it, Berri? I like it, actually. Well, what a good thing. The bad thing about online sites is that if you don't believe in a story, you hide all the information. So, I'm looking for a way to... Even if it's 10 years old. More or less. More or less? Yes. Or is it the first time you start looking for it? Or have you seen another price for the air conditioning? It's the first time you start looking for the first person to call me. Now I'm going to send some to you to call me. I'm going to send you a phone call. There's no idea, right? Of course. On set. fifth in the . They are Yeah. Is that a centitre? Yes. Yeah. Here it says that the size of the house is getting lower than 700 to mid-100 square footage. Is that... Is it a lower-down ratio? I think so. No, I have no idea. To make it sincere. No, don't worry. Well, let's do something. Because I have your number, no? No. So, what do you think? Pay the money from the front and what is the impact? I don't know if you can tell how it works. It depends on how the house is. And what is it? Well, the other thing would be the... For example, apart from the AC, you can also consider the HIPAM. Because HIPAM is what gives it the environment to the village. But give me a price for the AC. And for this size, it must be one at a time in the middle. It must not be much. Okay. Let me... Tell me. Yes, because it is not that big either. Yes, with this size, this is more than enough. Let me see the price here and this size. And now I have a lot of money and I have also run it for you.

If you are calling about the Canada Digital Adoption Program, press 2. For corporate searches, press 3. To speak to an advisor, press 4. If you are... Please wait while we connect your call. Small business BC, please allow me help you. Hi, I'm Graff to know. I'm Amy Magina and I'm calling from Ontario. I spoke with Gary yesterday. Is there any way that I can speak with him again today? He's out of the office at an event today but he'll be back into the office tomorrow. Is there anything that can help you? Oh yeah, of course. So we are an Ontario based company and we are looking to expand in BC. Gary just gave me kind of overview and advice with regards to where to go, which organization to ask and then he asked me to go to CDVancouver and I want to go back to him to ask for good questions. So I know you can help you also. So we are an HIV company and would like to do a doctor go sales and I got the business license information from CDVancouver and then I just want to ask you if you could just tell me what else do I need to look at for me to be able to set this company up in Vancouver. I mean I'm not entirely sure what all the information that Gary did give you but how is the business registered in Ontario? Okay so we have an extra provincial extra provincial license in BC. Okay so you are registering BC then? Yes. Okay and then since you wanted to do the rec sales, another license, a business license needs to be applied in whatever CDVancouver wanted to do the work and I just want to ask you know what else do I need to know? Say the you know tax impacts, the bonding requirements or I'm not sure if you advise this kind of stuff if we're setting up a job. Yeah not on the tax side of things. Like I mean we can give you general information with regards to like GST and PST. But if you're talking more like on the accounting side of things for the business that would be something you'd have to talk to an accountant about. Okay okay no worries. There's a few other questions that you have there. Yeah. Okay so removing the accounting side that taxes each other is right. Anything that would you like to share? I'm sorry I just got there all the information before we really launch over there so I know the overall view of everything. Let me send you I mean we do have a checklist of basically go requirements for starting a corporation here in BC. So a lot of those records would still be the would be the same even though you've got like an extra provincial company because it is still treated as a as a corporation but I can send you that so that would give you sort of like the basics. I mean I think for the most part you've got everything covered the only missing pieces would essentially be whether you're required to register with works at BC for workers compensation. Oh sorry it's WSIB here it's WXFGBC. Yeah okay. Okay. Okay yeah and I yeah sorry for that. Yeah. Okay. No I don't I totally get it. Gary and I have been here for so long we still refer to it as the old term because that's what we did for over many years. So yeah so workers compensation and then insurance would essentially be the the only other thing that I can think of. Insurance for like for the company. Yeah. Okay if we think because we are selling HVAC and most here in Dari we we subcontract it you know and then that subcontractor who wanted to reassign him to BC but he's not on our payroll but he is a subcontractor. What will make the difference? You could always request because he is a subcontractor. You could always request that they have their own workers compensation their own insurance and things like that for for themselves right? Right okay. I started there. I started there I will call it employment for lack of better term but I was part of their contract right? Now let me I'm still going to send that information to you though just so you have it. Sorry give me a sec here. I think generally speaking I think you should be pretty good because you do have sort of everything that you need. Now in terms of the sales of the actual products or anything like that that would be for sure you'd need to get in contact with the provincial sales tax office to find out about what essentially would be taxable for any of the other products and I'll find for that PST number. GST typically I mean if you already have a GST number you would essentially use the same thing if the products are being built under your company and not the contractor like if he's not doing like individual billing if he's invoicing like if he invoicing on behalf of the the company and it's going through you then you would use your company's tax number. Does that make sense? Yeah. How about your email? Sure it's I'll spell it out for you. GST in golf. I India and November a alpha l lema yanki and November dot r ethyn Romeo and we weaver weaver as an weaving it's w e a we v e r and then e co and then h o m e dot com. Let me repeat that back to you just make sure I've got everything correctly here so that's Gina so g i n a and then Lynn L Y n dot r at w e a v e r e co h o m e dot com. That is correct. Okay sorry you were going to ask a question. Yes. Sorry I forgot my question but yes I was just another way. So the technician is done. How about the bonding requirements? I think I've heard from Gary the bonding requirements. Do they need to ask this from you? I can just find this out from the prevent the the money municipalities. So bonding for the like every time like bonding insurance or Yeah I think so bonding insurance. Yeah I don't really understand this but you just mentioned this if we need this requirement. I don't have any idea. Yeah so sometimes you would want to get like bonding insurance for the person especially if they're entering for example like residential homes and things like that just to just to offer like an additional level of security. protection and stuff like that. I don't know that it's necessarily required but let me just see here. And he's just doing sales right not actual installation. Where's he doing installation? Oh yeah we will be providing sales product services. So literally the people that will be hiring it's either a salesperson and technicians. Yeah technician can be a subcontractor salesperson can be you know someone we hired. Yeah yeah it just sounds like that's all just insurance. You could get in contact with they're called the surety bonds and you can actually get in contact with technical safety BC and they should be able to give you some some information. I don't know because I know there is some specific for a gas and electrical contractors. I'm not sure if there's any other specifically for HVAC. So you can give them a call. I believe that's maybe what Gary was talking about. So you can just give technical safety BC a call and then they should be able to to answer that for you. Okay right and if it's not needed in applying for business license I mean the primary requirements then I'll leave it later on but yeah I'll take that in mind. Okay, I'll give you the mind. I can give you the phone number if you want. Oh yeah please. Yeah technical safety BC. And then the phone number there is 1866. 566. Okay, 7233. Okay so this is technical safety BC. All right. Yeah and just to find out if you know for for HVAC contractors if they require a bond and then they should be able to answer that for you. All right and doing you go physical adress or whether we have an adress but like physical adress. You know well you've got if you've got it registered extra provincially right what address did you use there was that like a lawyer or I can't remember. So we have yeah the head office adress is our Ontario address. And then there's a name of a tourney the corporation or firm name and then there's a mailing address. And yes that's in the that's the issue address. Yeah that's all you need. Okay um you mean indeed. But you are you are going to need some type of adress for the license right. Okay. For for the city. So yeah we have an address I think the reason being we use the corporation or firm name there's an agency applied on our behalf is because for the physical mail they will be receiving the mail and they'll be sending this mail to us in Ontario. I think that's the reason we're in your virtual office kind of thing. A virtual office yes that's correct. Yeah yeah and that should be yeah that should be the usually the address that you would want to use is whatever you're using for BC as your address. I see um okay I think yeah you will be sending the basic yeah the basic requirements. Yeah I'm going to send that to you now I was just waiting just to be sure that there was nothing else to send you so yeah that is correct and I want to it's just difficult if you missed something and something is dependent on that requirement and everything it's just frozen you know what I mean. SBB checklist okay. I mean it is just basic information but I think I think it pretty well covered there's just a couple of things to just maybe look into um especially on the on the taxation side of it and just to have a quick look there is some information there with both GST and provincial self-tax on the on the checklist and then workers compensation whether it's whether it's a requirement I've been trying to think it is because you are a corporation. Yeah all right what's the difference between the provincial license and then the business license so the background of my question is we were under impression that provincial license is already sufficient for us to carry out work in BC and now we were just surprised that every municipality has its own rules and regulations and we need to apply for different if you have like seven or eight municipalities that good that means if have different rules that means it licenses potentially so yeah yeah so with the with construction and trades they do have what's called an inter municipal business license so you can apply you apply for your license in one municipality and if you're going to be doing work in say six different municipalities kind of thing you can apply for that that inter municipal which allows you to work in multiple city but only still having one license. Yeah so I think this is a good inter municipal utility license and where should I apply for this one? So if you're doing the city of Vancouver you can apply for that for it there at the same time so it's essentially an additional $250 and it'll cover six different municipalities in the Metro Vancouver area. Oh $250 okay yeah okay um okay I think this is better right? Instead of me and you can and you can let them know I mean you still have to apply for the for the main license but then for an additional $250 I think they they include the inter municipal so you can ask them when you're when you're doing that application um how to how to get that inter municipal business license as well. Okay so can I can I ask this question to um CD of Vancouver? Yes yep oh yeah so the one's that issue it? Yes I see okay I know things are done a little bit different here differently here in BC so your provincial registration just essentially gives you that permission to be able to operate the business in BC right where it offers like the name protections that's like that allows you to open bank accounts and all of that kind of stuff but where it differs from Ontario where Ontario you have a master business license BC uh each municipality manages their own um zoning and bylaw regulations. So it's just in our license to operate up and up a book bank account and there's uh there are limitations. Well the bank account is based on the the provincial registration so not the municipal the municipal specifically for the actual work being done right so it's like an operating permit. I see it's a little bit different. All right okay um yeah is there anything else I can I need to know just before I end this call? I think that's about it.

That's a great question. The reason for the reach out is because we do have a team that goes over everything in terms of pricing, installation, all of that. Because when you put the ad, how much do you currently have an AC and a furnace or you don't have an AC? Oh, yeah, I have a furnace and just units. Like I have a boiler system, so I'm just wondering if you have duck lists as well. Yeah, we do provide doc list. We do provide doctor doc list. What type of how many heads were you thinking?

Why? Why do you want to know? Size of the home, give us a better idea of the right sizing for you. Okay. No, it's fine. Different apartments have different units. Okay. So it's not like we need to figure out anything like that. There's four apartments in the house. Gotcha. So what we could do is I can't double take a look at here on my guide schedule.

Where if I got to do have it, the right address and the right email in on file? Yeah. Okay. Good. Can you email me your information? And maybe like what is the, like I can give you some specifics because we're getting a few quotes. So I can give you specifics as to what instead of wasting somebody's time to everybody's time to come out here and do the quote and all that stuff. And I can give you like unit names and everything and kind of describe the situation for you in an email. And then maybe you can get back to me with like a rough quote. Yeah, we could do that because instead of sending somebody over the way that we do it here is that we actually do it virtually. So it's online. Oh, okay. Like you mean like a Zoom call or something? Exactly. Yes. Oh, okay. The main thing about the Zoom call is just that it gives you an idea of like the company. You get to see what's included in the packages in terms of warranties. It gives you a better breakdown of everything and a couple of options when it comes to the financing part because I know you're probably, you do have the option of always pay it upfront, but we do also work with like a financial company that if that's an option that you want to consider, they're going to be able to be more specific.

So I was thinking that can we remove the water pump? Let me take a look. I have it right here. I didn't... Yeah, they put that it's a co-signer or a alternative that you reduce the amount by 3500. So I'm thinking if we remove the water pump, the heat pump would be... I don't know. But try that one. I hope it happens and find it good. Here it says that the loan amount, they can only approve up to 3000. That's what it said. They can only approve up to 3000. Which is very low. It's very little. No, that wasn't what I got yesterday. I'm just looking at it here. Okay. If you want to check on your end, double check it too. This is the one that I'm looking at here. Let me see. It's... ...it's... ...it's... ...it's... ...it's... Raise, give me one. Let me see something here. Oh no, I was too 40 or can I never mind. Okay, yeah. I will put this down. They said they choose the low up to 3000. We reduce up to 3000. Oh, so I thought they said buy to 3500. Yeah, that doesn't cover really anything. That's the problem with that, you know. If we go back and forth with them, try to make this work. It's just that for some reason it didn't get... They just didn't get it approved. That is fine, no problem. Sorry about that, Grace. It was soon I was talking to you though. Okay, all right.

20240522-150259_2208_+14162460907_Outgoing_Auto_2197845575043.mp3," Hi, Maryam. Hi, good afternoon, Brad, how are you today? Good. Awesome. I got your email. So I just wanted to give you a shout out. Now, we'll get time to speak. Yeah, just give me like two minutes to gather what I'm doing up and go to another room. Okay. Okay, let me, you want me to call you back in about two to three minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm here. Okay. Perfect. So let me just pull up your email here again. And I know that you were. Oh, you were looking for the three template acts. Okay. Okay. And then you want to tell about the filter, right? Yes. Let me get to my message to you. Yes. Yes. Yes. About the half of filters and the, what is it called? The room sensors. Yes. And then there was the warranty, I believe, as well. Yeah. There was a couple of other things, but I don't have. So let me just get to it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Now I'm reading what I sent you. Okay. So I'm. I'm under. I think it's not just a help of filter. Is it? It's some sort of unit that fits into it. It's just a slide in, have the filter. No, no, no, it's a unit. Well, it's up to you with there's two different types. We can do. There is one like full unit that fits in with a UV light system as well. That's going to be more expensive. And then there's the regular HEPA filter system. But it is kind of like a unit or, you know, that sits in the dockwork, right? For the full. Yeah. Into the stock work, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's the one. You have a UV light that won't need. You don't need. Okay. Now, where are you? Yeah. So I can. I guess my first question to you, Brenda, were you okay with paying up front? And then waiting for the. Okay. Because then I can. I can work out a little bit of an extra discount. So if we're making up the. You said that to me. So. Yeah. I had that in my plant. I was like, okay, hey, hey, anymore, you can get a discount. Why not? And then I know you can from 2700. That's also including the basement, right? Yeah. 2700. But we look there. Yeah. So three ton makes sense. I think it does. Yeah. Yeah. Three to let's. For that size. And it's fairly spread out between the two floors. So. So, okay. Let's see what we can do. So the three ton blade. X. 2, 15. All in. The warranty. We are doing. So the warranty on its own. Because by the way, we pay a separate insurance on it. We provide you with that insurance number. So the valid warranty. And if you're looking for the 10. You know, 10 year full protection. They call it. So you're covered on everything for 10 years. Yeah. So that's why. That's why we're doing this. Yeah Want to know. Yeah. And the. And the. They actually charge separately. I believe they charge. 1600. We are doing a discount or promotion. For the month of May for at nine sixty. So I'm giving that to you. Because you're quite a bit more than the other company. The other company said. Because they included it. Right from the beginning. And if I didn't want it, they take off 500. And then it's not going to be a good deal. But it depends on what they're what insurance company they're going with. Or if it is with an insurance company. Because what happens. And this is why we're a little bit more expensive with the warranty. A lot of companies just offer the warranty. But it's just basically word of mouth. From their company. The when you have a warranty through an insurance. That means let's say. I mean, not going. Would it stop going. Happen anytime soon. But let's say we were to go to business or anything like that. We actually assign you an insurance number that you always have access to that. Warren P even if let's say we wanted a business or disappeared. Right. So. Okay. How long have you been in business? Oh, we've been in business for eight years. And we're we're not in a license. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're licensed in Ontario. We're licensed in Alberta. We're licensed in BC. So we're not going out of business anytime soon. But you know, we were. You know, we're not just looking to just, you know, squeeze out. We believe. I mean, a heat pump is a long term investment in your home. Yeah, exactly. So warranty is super, you know, super important. So anyway, I can give it to you for for nine sixty. That is a discounted rate through the insurance. And we're going to give you the insurance number. And then the filter. The filter. So again, it's a full filter system. Let me see what I can do. Because now we're doing a second product. So. Two, ten. The regular price width. So I'm going to say the regular price of the half a filter. And then if I include the centers as well. The centers are, I believe you're about one fifty like market price. Like that's how they about one fifty each. And then the half a filter is about, I believe it's about seventeen hundred. Let me see what I can do. Okay. I'll tell you what. Since you're including another service now or product. I can give you the combination of the half a filter with the two centers. Okay. So that connects to the smart thermostat. And give you a discount if you go with the full warranty and the heat pump system, of course. I can bring it down to twelve hundred, which is basically taking five hundred dollars off. Okay. So that would be twelve hundred for the sensors and the half a. And have full half a filter system. Yeah. So all in if you want the full warranty. So what was it the full tenure protection plan at the nine sixty and then the full half a filter system and the two centers. Okay. It is all together with the heat pump, of course, and installation and all. So 84 ten plus a justy fallen. And if you pay a front, which you're looking to do. This is coming directly from me though. So this is the, you know, the best that I can offer is I can give an additional five percent on. So that means like you call me eight percent before. So it depends if you're paying. It depends if you're paying by cash or credit card. So if you cash, I can do, do you know if you're going to do cash or credit card? Well, if I get a cash use check or whatever, whatever you call them. So it's the same as cash, but I don't have to carry. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. When I say cash, we mean certified check. Yeah. Yeah. So I can give you the, if I told you eight percent, then that I'll give you the eight percent. Okay. So, and you've given me the three ton furnace at 5950, right? The three ton heat pump system, right? You mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the three ton, this is a blade X for looking at. Yeah. Yeah. So the regular price was 6250 plus a trustee. But I guess you're, you're looking at what I just counted you at the eight percent probably. So yeah. No, that was before we discussed that. That was the price you gave me when I said I wanted a price on a three ton. No, in our conversation at the end, you said if I paid cash, she'd give me eight percent off. So, you know, it is what you quoted me before an event. Yeah. So if you have you allow me to explain, we were looking at the two and a half ton. If you see in the email, that was 5950. Yeah. It was 5,500, right? It was a, let me go back 5950. So that was the two and a half ton. But then remember, we discussed your like, let's just pump it to the three ton. What's the difference? So I emailed you back on May 9th and responded the cost of the blade X three ton instead of the two and a half is 6250 plus a trustee. Okay. Let me find that. Yeah. Just double check that. I know we were going back. It should be on the same email thread. But you responded. I just found it. Yeah. And that also includes the. What do you call it? Smart thermostat. This is my thermostat. And the solution. Yeah. All in. Okay. And that's before the eight percent, of course. So what I quoted you with everything else on them, of course, we give the eight percent for the certified check, you know, on top. Yeah. Yeah. Which would be what was the 84 times. If we look at eight percent, 72, 73, let's say 84 times 73. So it is essentially be 7738 plus HST with the eight percent discount. Yes, just. 7738 is what I just heard, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So. Oh, and the other thing was that other thing that you had on offer. The energy. Or whatever you call it. Yeah. We were offering it for that week. When are you looking to get this done? Right away. Right away. Okay. Yeah. I can include that that in for free. Okay. So do you want to recap all of that and then come in what the next step is? So the next step would be were you looking to do the audits and go through the government loan as well or no? I don't know if I qualify honestly because I'm a murp. I'm three units and a building, which remember I told you right from the beginning. But I own the building and I live in this unit. Yeah. Yeah. So it is. I wouldn't qualify anyway. But I want to know that I can write it off on my taxes. Oh, yeah. That's all it's it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Mostly because I do have a lot of corporate like homes that are, you know, properties under the corporation. And all of my clients write it off. So that's not an issue. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's a murp. It makes things way more complicated. And because it's a three unit, I don't think it would, it would qualify. And you know what? To write it off, doing it corporate. That's actually going to probably save you more in the long run versus because with murbs, let's say yours did qualify, which I don't, the three units, what doesn't. It's only if it's two. But let's say it did, I mean, the audit fee is about $1,600 plus HSP. That's a loan. And that's something you have to get done with the, with the government loan. Right. So that's an additional expense. And then, you know, so probably end up working out a little bit better for you if you just do it the corporate way with, you know, with the discount that I'm giving you upfront. And then being able to write it off. Yeah. And then, you know, I think it's a little bit more complicated because I can't really do it for the other units, because they're paying for little. I've had them as kind of for 15 years. And they're paying like for a massive apartment like mine. Yes. And what you'd pay for a one bedroom, one bath. Oh wow. So it's just not something. I'm not that generous. They were, you know, paying a reasonable amount. It would make sense. Yeah. It's not. Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. Okay. Let's do it that way, because I think it makes more sense. It's actually good that you're under it's under a corporation. And because being able to write it off is going to benefit you more for sure. Yeah. Now, I'd like the filter, the half of filter, to go under my personal name. Because then I can write it off as a health benefit, like a medical expense. Oh, okay, gotcha. Okay. So you might have to put it on a separate invoice, I think. Yeah. Is there any reason why you can't do that? No. No. I'm just trying to think if there's, like we can write a separate invoice for it. How long, how often do I have to change the filters by the way, too? Let me check with my, yeah. I like to check with my installation technical manager. I think, you know what, I don't want to give you your own answer. Let me just double confirm, because it's, I think it also depends on the actual system you're getting installed. I know we go with, you know, very, you know, good quality systems. So I think it depends on that as well. But let me confirm that with you. What all of you Brenda is, when are you, you said as soon as possible. So are you looking for weekdays weekend? It doesn't matter. Well, I have a kind of a crazy time going on right now, but let me get my calendar out. Sure. What the next little bit is. Yeah, and to do it, do you have to block off my driveway and stuff? To do the install. No, like they're going to hold on. You have like one vehicle maybe? Yeah. Like to come with a work truck. So they come with a work truck and all of you know. So I just remove my car and you can go into my spot and not block anybody that way. And that way I don't have to make special arrangements with tenants. Okay. Yep, that works. That works. If you have, if you have a, like a spot, it's like a work, they have a work truck. Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. I am away the fourth to the ninth of June. I'm going to go to the next week, which is the last week. I don't know if it happens that fast, but I mostly be around. Next week, let me just double check. Except not Friday, Friday, late afternoon. Not Friday, late afternoon. Okay. I mean, you're in Toronto. So what's, uh, yeah, I'm basically killing Dundas. Yeah, our like our, we had two head offices. One in Woodbridge, one in Toronto, like that's where I'm located, north York. So we have guys all across Ontario, but we can, I mean, I can get someone in. Let me just see. We, I mean, we can do it as early as possibly this weekend or early next week, if that works for you. This weekend, we're away, but Monday to Friday afternoon, like Friday noon. Okay. Okay. Why don't we, uh, what I can do is I can tentatively book you in for Monday, let's say. Okay. Once we go through the, uh, so it's, uh, it's the virtual agreements and also we have to do the deposit as well. Right. Everything forwards over to our dispatch team, um, an operations team. They have access to all the, um, you know, all the technicians and experts availability. Um, and they can confirm it 100% but on my end, I see Monday shouldn't be an issue if that works. Okay. So Monday is the 27. Okay. So they'll confirm the time and all of that. And they're pretty flexible with that. So what I'll need to do in this case, um, Brenda in order to secure that in for you and kind of start the next step. I do need to send you the virtual agreement. Um, okay. Do you need to walk through it together? Is that okay with you? Yes. That's fine. What I'm going to do for now, just, just so it's easier for, um, our team to see everything on one invoice. I'm going to put everything including the HEPA filter. Just for now to just start, you know, and, and port it, but I will write you a separate invoice with the HEPA filter under your name. Okay. Is that okay? Thank you. I'm going to just like when it comes to the paint because you're doing upfront and things like that. It's just easier for accounting to have everything on one invoice, but I will send you a separate invoice. That's not an issue. Okay. Just bear with me a moment. Let me go back to your file. And then before I send anything, Brenda, I do of course want to confirm that I have the crack selling of your phone name. Brenda, BRENDA, BRENDA and then I have your last name spelled as COGHLIN. Yes. That's fine. That's my maiden name. Okay. Perfect. So just bear with me a minute. And the business number do you need that? Do you have it? The, uh, I don't think it's necessarily needed. You know what? I don't think it's necessarily needed as long as the corporation is under your name, which it is. When you write it off, that's what they look at. They look at your phone. Yeah. Okay. So the corporation is probably underneath. So change it to NIEV. And as a norm. Yeah. I, as in India, is an elephant, V is in Victor, is an elephant, S is in Sam. Okay. I'm just in the process of changing back to COGHLIN, but I haven't done it yet. Okay. Okay. No worries. Yeah. Let me, let's do that because that, uh, that would be better than, you know, uh, okay. Let me go back and let me edit that in the system. Okay. Okay. Okay. Brenda, just bear with me like two to three minutes. I'm still sure on the line I'm just going to mute you some upraving in your ear, but I'm just changing the name here and putting the agreement together. Okay. Okay. I'll share with me a couple of minutes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Mary, I'm calling you from Weaver, E. Colhome. I just wanted to have a virtual appointment scheduled with myself at two o'clock. We push it to two fifteen for the heat pump. Yeah. And do you receive the link to join? No, I try to do it and it seems like it doesn't work. Oh. Didn't hear me try to do it. For some reason it's not connecting. I'm not sure what. I'm in bad service for, I'm in bad area for internet service. That's one thing. Oh, I see. Okay, are you at home right now or are you not? No, I haven't found already because there's more service than at home. There's more service at home, right? No, at home isn't that odd. I don't have a, I don't have a home. Oh, you don't have internet. Oh, no, that's not good. Okay, no worries. If you don't have any access to internet service, we can alternatively do it over the phone. If that's easier. Yeah, it makes better for me. Okay, sure. No problem. Let me just disconnect. And we'll continue over the phone. So, Henry, thank you so much for joining me this afternoon. A very quick introduction to myself. So, again, my name is Miriam. I have had the pleasure of being with the company for about three years now. I've learned a lot about becoming more eco-friendly and more importantly helping homeowners become a lot more efficient with their homes. Okay. So that is a little bit about myself. Henry, tell me a bit about yourself and what's the main goal or motive for getting a heat pump installed in the home? Well, dang it. I'm going to use AC quit. And that's why I'm looking for some great upgrade. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah, yeah. Some newer. Yeah, so that affecting. Sorry, go ahead. Is that affecting this great up? The new sat-up or something? Right. Yeah, so the heat pump is great because you're not just going to get the efficient cooling or AC. You're also going to get efficient heating, right? Yeah. So, heating and cooling. Now, how long have you lived in the home for? You have 11 years now. Just over. Come on over. Have you done any other upgrades since people have there to make it more efficient or would this be the first thing? That's the first thing for the furnace. Parts for you, then I'll move a little bit. Okay. So your AC system completely broke down like it's not working at all, right? It doesn't work at all now. First works good, but not in other AC. Not the AC. And you're on a gas furnace, right? Yes. How old is your furnace? I don't know. How does it build on a 1995? Okay. I'm assuming that I'm not sure, but I'm assuming that the first one to put in. Is there a original one? I think that's where it is. But you said it's working fine. Like there's no issues currently with the furnace, right? Not a furnace, no issues. Okay. Okay. So that's good because you're with a heat pump system the AC needs to be replaced where you can keep your existing gas furnace as an emergency backup. Okay. Like heat for us. So are you familiar with the heat pumps, Henry, and you know how they work and what makes them know? Okay. So I'll keep it as simple as possible because you can get kind of complicated or you know complex of the technology. But heat pumps run off of a law called thermodynamics. So what that means is it uses the air to create heat exchange. And that's what's going to provide you with efficient heating and cooling throughout the year. Okay. Now heat pumps do run solely off of electricity only. However, it does not use electricity to actually create the heat. It only uses electricity to simply transfer over the heat into your home. Okay. So the electricity consumption with the heat pumps are very minimal and that's what makes them so efficient. Okay. Okay. Now just to look at kind of the cost savings, how would you say your gas still goes into the wintertime? Well, we looked at it yesterday as usually the cold winter and cold month. That's about 120 between 120. That's somewhere. Okay. And then what was your hydro like in the summer when you had your AC running? I was about high. It was 160. Okay. Okay. Let's go with that. All right. So because I want to look at kind of the savings, the main savings you're going to see is in the is for the gas. Because the heat pumps will heat up your home efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. So only when temperatures get colder than that, which is not going to happen very often, especially in your area. Just during those extreme days, your gas furnace will kick in automatically as an emergency backup. Yeah. So your gas still is going to be cut or reduced by about 80, 90 per cent or even more. Okay. Right. So that's where you're going to see kind of the biggest savings. Okay. And I just want to confirm the square footage of the home. I have approximately 1500 square feet. Yeah. It makes sense. Okay. And do you know the approximate tons size of your AC system? I release one and a half tons. One and a half. Okay. So with the heat pumps, let me just double check. But I would, so with heat pumps, they're also calculated in tons. Okay. Yeah. But since it's incorporating heating now, it's not just cooling, right? It's heating and cooling. You always want to size up slightly with the heat pump. So I would recommend the two tons for your home. Okay. Okay. So that's what I'm going to quote you on here. And then I do also just want to mention Henry, I'm sure you're probably aware of this as well. I know we mentioned it when we booked you in. Yeah. The government was offering rebates in the past for heat pumps, but they got rid of all rebate programs as of January. Okay. But they did extend another incentive program that is coming to an end soon as well. But have you heard of it? The government zero percent interest free funding or loan for 10 years completely open? No, I never heard of it. So essentially how it works is if you get approved, the government will give you the funds after you've installed it. I mean, you have to install it and pay for the product. We submit the invoice. And when the government has seen that you've gotten the product installed and you know, invoice, they will give you the funds back and sold. And they give you a period of 10 years to pay it off at zero percent interest. Okay. Is that something you'd be interested in learning more about? No, no, no, no. But right now, for now, I'm thinking you'd have fixed it. Telling my kids and my wife to run a house and I'm worried about it. I'm sure they understand that. So you're not interested in the incentive program you're looking to just pay up front? Yes. Okay, okay. So then there's the need to have. I mean, it's, yeah, go ahead. That's the right money, you know what I mean? The right price. For sure. I need it soon. That's because it's warms off pretty quick and... Yeah, yeah, I hear you, I hear you. Okay. So what else do then? Let me go through the package details with you as far as what's in the package and the system. And then we'll get into the, you know, the savings and the cost breakdown. Okay. So there's two major components to the heat pump. The first is the outdoor unit. This of course is what's going to replace your AC system or unit. And then there's the internal part of the heat pump that connects to the outdoor unit. It's called a Unix-Tased Coil. This is what we connect, you know, in or on your existing furnace. Again, we do use the cold climate heat pump system. So just to confirm the heat pump will run efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. So they do kind of run in conjunction or communicate hungry, but they are still two completely separate systems. Yeah. So, you know, just to confirm the heat pump will run to that temperature. And then temperatures that get colder than that. The gas furnace will kick in automatically as an emergency backup. Okay. Okay. So again, that's where you're going to see the biggest savings because the heat pumps are so efficient to that temperature. Yeah. You're probably going to knock off your gas about 80, 90% in the winter. Okay. Okay. Now, do you have a smart thermostat at home? No. So we're going to include a brand new generation model smart thermostat that's compatible with the full system. And then we have our warranty. The good thing with the warranty is it is done separately or directly through us. It's not just a basic manufacturing warranty. For the standard, we give you 10 years on all parts one year labor and you do have 24 seven service and access to it at all times. Okay. So that's essentially our full package there. Henry, now. I guess before I get down to the cost breakdown, just to quickly touch up on the savings. So for just to keep it simple, I mean for gas. If I look at the average there, so you're spending, let's say, just under 2000 a year, it looks like on your gas bill. Yeah. Okay. So basically with these heat pumps, like I said, the main thing is the winter and the heating. It's going to save you anywhere between 80 to 90%. So even if we looked at, let's say, about 80% savings for the year, just to kind of give you a quick idea. That means you're going to be saving about 1500 annually. And again, that's just based on what you spent probably as of last year. I'm not sure if you know as of April 1st, they actually increased federal carbon tax and fuel cost. So unfortunately next winter, the gas prices are going to go up, right? But 1500, if we break that down monthly, you're going to save about 130 bucks a month, you know, when you switch over to the system. Just to do, you know, quick e-z math. Now, let's get to the cost. So the cost that I'm going to give you, Henry's is basically going to confirm or going to include rather the full package that I just went over with you. So just to quickly confirm, it's the full cold climate hybrid heat pump system, the outdoor unit indoor unit, the smart thermostat, the warranty and then full installation as well. Okay. So, and then we're looking at the two tons. Let's just see the two tons. So you'd be looking at 6000 even plus HST, all in. Okay. Okay. So that in that includes the install and warranty as well. Everything by time is all done. Yeah, that's all in 6000 even plus HST. Okay. Talk to my wife and talk to her about it and I'll get back to you. Yeah. And if you said you're not interested in the government program, you're okay to pay it front. Yeah. So in that case, if you do a pay up front, we do give in a little bit of an additional incentive. I can give you an additional 5% off that price, which means I can take off $300. So that means I can bring it down if you're looking to just pay up front, 57 plus HST. Okay. And how long I would take you if I pay it and then install it. How long are you looking to get you said as soon as possible? Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to my wife. Maybe today yet and I'll call you back here with that phone. So what do we do this? I'm going to send you a quick email with all the information. You want to talk to your wife today? I'm in the office. I'm going to talk to your wife today. I'm going to talk to her about it. I'm going to talk to her about it. I'm going to talk to her about it. I'm going to talk to her about it. I'm going to talk to her about that to her about what's going on. Okay. So I'm going to talk to her about it also. Oh yeah. Don't ask that. Like always something matters. Okay. 이게 어떻게 해야 되세요?

20240522-141918_2282_+14164191710_Outgoing_Auto_2197827103043.mp3," Call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone. Hey, is this John? This is, Hey, John is Alex from Weaver regarding, I just got your email. I'm doing pretty well. How are you? Good, good. Yeah, Alex, I wanted to go over that quote, you sent over. Are you guys, you guys are based in Vaughn? We are. We are. Are you in the States? We are in Canada. So we are actually by February, which is close to North York. OK, so you guys have a shop there or do you guys just, do you guys just a call center? We are a head office. So all of our team is in pretty much like our part of it is, we do have the sales guys. We have the project management team, you know, all the financing, everything is in here. We do have another shop, which is all our inventory, the technicians, all of that stuff, but we handle the process. They just show up to your home and do the installation and all the service costs and stuff like that. OK, yeah, so I'm just looking over the quote. So let me just pull up your, your, sorry, let me just pull up the file. Hold on, sorry. Yeah, so your quote was, I believe, so, 8900 was a tax and let me take a look at it here. So you got a cold climate heat pump outdoor and indoor unit, TOSR 2.0, 2.0, outdoor. Yes, it was the dockless one, right? Yes. Perfect. And when we spoke, you mentioned that you were considering, like, paying it upfront, no financing, nothing like that, right? Well, yeah, this, this one is an upfront cost, or is this, did this include financing? That one here, let me take a look. I believe though, the price that I gave you, gave because you decided you wanted to do upfront. Yeah, I think I did give you a discount because of the, there's an upfront of one payment. So that goes with the one payment. Yes, let me do that quickly here. Yeah, so I wrote the number I believe, 8150 plus taxes. So it's 9200. 9200 or 90. Yes. So that's that we can't finance it with that. With that, it would be if you decide to pay it upfront. If you want to finance it, the good thing is that we do have it, is a little bit more flexible. You can get, you know, if you get approved the full funds at $7.99 interest for $95. What we could do if you decide to finance it is that we can apply for you for the government loan if you're interested in it. How would the thing go? Go on loan work, though. If you have that, have to come to your house and check everything out. They would have to, we would have to schedule you for an audit. The energy audit is just for them to, you know, check it out and it's pretty much like a validation for them to actually, like see that you needed it. The good thing is that the cost of that audit could be added to the loan as well. The only benefit of that loan is that is, is here percent interest. So, so how much, how much would you say with the government, with the government loan, with the government rebate? Like, would they, it came to the houses out a lot of heat loss. It's like a hundred-year-old cottage. Like, are they going to go there and say, well, you need this, this is not done before you get the upgrade. Yeah. Before you can get the rebate, what kind of rebate is it? It's not a rebate, it's just a loan. Oh, yeah. So essentially they will give you the, that amount, they will give you the total amount. They will give you that amount in a loan and you can just pay it off in the next 10 years. And there's no interest on it. There's no interest on it. Yeah. And what would the cost, there's a cost for them to go and check it out? I $750. So they're adding some interest. Yeah. Okay, so just go back to this. So it would be $920950 with tax. So the toll stock, so if this is with two indoor units, it is with two indoor units. Yes. And the toll stock, how long is that this model this brand been around? Because I haven't really heard of it. They've been around a very long time because they're manufactured by media in a degree, which is the two biggest manufacturers in the world. The biggest thing with them is that they are almost like very similar to good men. Have you, I'm sure you've seen good men, right? No, I haven't seen the good. No. They're very similar to good men, comparing terms of quality, like a efficiency levels is up to 25. Is there coal climates? All the model that we carry is our coal climate. So that would be essentially there would be what is it called the way down to minus 30. Okay. And is it 10 year warranty on it and one year parts of labor? I think yours parts, one year labor. 10 year parts. So the parts is basically the compressors. That's the only thing that's the only thing of it. Is that or I mean all around like if you ever come across any difficulty with the with the brand, like with the parts. Okay. So it can't be part of the ship. Or you just have to get the labor to install it after the. Yes. Okay. And what's the does this get mounted? Did I see some pictures of does it get mounted like on your house or is it going to go on a cement pad? It depends of your home. Every home is a little bit different. I have seen them both. Sometimes it goes on the floor. Sometimes they hang it on the side of the wall. It depends of the home. Okay. So you were looking at two heads, right? For this. So it's both what you have. So it's 18,000 to you, right? Yes. And then you would, if we decided to go ahead, would there be like an inspection by your team to come and take a look and say, well, this is going to go here. This is going to be, you guys haven't really seen the place. We do a assessment installation same day. So they would do that we're doing assessment before they install it to get you approval on everything where they're going to place it, how they're going to do it, how's going to be connected inside. Once we get your approval, you we have the green light that will install it. Okay. And how long would it install take like if we decided to go ahead? I talked to my wife. I'm just I have another call with another guy for your place is good. This is the other brand that they're using a different brand. It's a little bit more expensive, but it's more of a to be G2. A little bit more expensive. Yes, I don't know why brand are they doing. Uh, could you do. Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, so it's a little bit more of a well known brand. I think it's been around longer, but it isn't a little bit more expensive. So I'm going to just talk to them. But if we did just back to go to every zero, Alex, is it just the deposit that we put down and then what I would do is I will forward you the agreement. We've been data, we've been that agreement. It's going to be everything stated on it. And then what we could do is, you know, if you decide to sign in before we were with us, we would pretty much we would take a 500 dollars deposit.

Do you want to get a new heat pump? Yeah, I want to have a heat pump which is working without the thermos. Look, uh, that's for in that case, where you can have it, like with the heat pump, you always need to have a furnace because the heat pump it doesn't directly get connected to the duct work, right? But what you can do is you can get a heat pump with an air handler. The air handler is basically an electric furnace, which you can use as a backup. Okay. So whatever. And uh, I don't have to have oil then that's yeah, I know oil. Yeah. So that's it. So I need a cold and everything. Sure. And how much you are not charging me? How much you are charging me? Okay.

So every year, how many do you pay for a soil? So this year I don't say I don't shoot oil. I don't use furnace with the oil. I use an extra heater and that saves me a lot of money.

20240522-151734_2203_+19057730626_Outgoing_Auto_2197852236043.mp3," May I help you? Hi, I'm D'Aufton Owen. My name is Gina and I can speak to Eric. Just a moment please. Thank you. Hello, Eric speaking. Hi, I'm D'Aufton, Eric. My name is Gina and I was talking to you last month regarding the Manage Turbo Extra provincial license application. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I did not get back to you, Eric, because we kind of changed our market strategy. So that's why I put that in hold. But however, I'm contacting you because we put our money to a plan and hold in one to do BC. Do you do this kind of stuff in BC? We do. Yes. Okay. All right. So we already have an extra provincial license with BC. However, my research said if you want to do direct sales in Vancouver or other nearby cities and municipalities, we need to get licenses and permits to give you a background. Again, we want each of our companies and we wanted to do daughter-door sales. So we wanted someone to apply on our behalf the licensing and permits for a city. Oh, I see. Okay. That's that sort of thing we don't do. So all we do is incorporate, we only do the corporate registrations. As far as applying for specific licenses, it doesn't really make sense for you to hire somebody to do that. I mean, the thing is that there's no legal knowledge required for those types of registrations. They're going to be asking business questions rather than anything that you need legal knowledge for. So that's the reason most lawyers don't get involved with that kind of thing. Right. All you do is you contact them in municipalities where you want to do business. And also the provincial government to find out if there's direct seller licenses that's required for British Columbia. I can tell you that just give me one second. But in terms of what we do, it's the corporate extra provincial registrations. Okay. So direct sellers. So yeah, so you need PST registration. PST? PST, provincial sales tax. Okay. It ultimately depends on the PST depends on specifically the type of products that you're selling. And then consumer protection BC has direct sales, contract requirements. And then each municipality then regulates. But I mean, if you're looking for a lawyer to help you to tell you specifically what's required for each jurisdiction, we can do that research for you. But there's also websites that you can do that. There's something called bizpal.ca. B-A-Z-P-A-L.CA. I'm sorry. Let me just go back. It's B. B is in Bob. I said P-A-L. P-A-L. P-A-L. T-A-L. Tango-A-L. Faleima. No, no, no. Papa-A-Lima. Okay. B is Paul. Dot-C-A. If you go to that website and you put in, it'll ask you what's your business, where do you intend to operate the business? It'll give you a list by municipality. You put in the municipality, but it'll give you a list of what you need. Okay. Right. Okay. So if you think case that say, for example, I'm not confident to do it, I want to do it right, and I want to hire a counselor or a lawyer who will advise us what to do. How much is your rate? Eric. Yeah. So for something like that, it would be $275 an hour. $275 an hour. Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. Let me think about it, and let me just do all the every serage. Yeah. Like I say, most people don't do it, and that's the reason that we don't really offer it as a service, because it does not. It's expensive. It's expensive, and it's time-consuming, and so the whole, because every jurisdiction is a little bit different, so it's not like I can give you a single answer. It's like I can give you a single answer with just telling you, oh, it's this. It's very specific as to what you're doing, where you're doing it, how you're doing it, whether you have employees in that jurisdiction, different things like that. And so, and with most of it, it's not a matter of interpreting the law, or preparing paperwork in a specific way. It's just contacting, it's basically contacting the relevant government authorities, but usually by phone is what we do. We just say to them what's going to be required, and they give us a list, and then we'll tell you, but the applications themselves are generally fairly straightforward. They don't need any legal knowledge. They're just like, where's your business located? How are you going to be selling? How much are you going to be selling? Sometimes there's bonding requirements, but they generally don't require any specialized knowledge. Okay, I see. All right. Okay, so I heard consumer protection BC, CDO Vancouver, so these are the organizations that I need to reach out to in order for me to get information apart from the V-SPA website. Yeah, those would be the primary ones. I might need to contact. And then also you have to look at the tax impact. So whether you do need PST, because in British Columbia, it's not HST, it's GST and PST. So, and PST does apply to certain product sales. It depends on for a product, it depends, I think, on whether it's being attached to the real property, or whether it's something separate. But either way, it's something you need to look at to determine based on the specific products that you sell, whether PST registration is going to be required. Okay, right. All right. Sounds complex to me, but thank you for your advice. Okay. And yeah, for money, Tobah, I'll get back to you as soon as we redirected our marketing strategy to that province. Okay. So, all right. Thank you so much, Eric. You're welcome. Take care. All right.

Weaverick home. It's W-E-A-V-E-R-E-C-O-H-O-M-E. I haven't signed up yet with you, so we are still on the transition of signing up with you.

So I just give your comfort rates everything. You just need the form for 38 and 40. Yeah, what I'll do while I have you on the phone here, if you just hold on to a second. I'm just going to. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, Gina, I've just sent you an email. Okay. Just want to make sure that you get it and you understand. I got it. Yeah. And if you can, there's two forms. If you can just complete those. 38 and 40. And then what we have to do is then ask Red will release to me the password for your company. And then we'll have access to be able to make all the changes and then ultimately deal with your annual reports as well. Okay. I'll fill this out and also Tim while you are already in the phone, I will ask you for this. I might need your service for for another for another that for another activity that you wanted to do in BSM. Not sure if you're doing this, but nonetheless, I just want to take this forward with you. So we are planning to do some business in Vancouver, Richmond, like 60 piece across or municipalities across BC. So as you know, we have extra provincial and then I called BC registry, even say to Vancouver and they asked us to to apply for licensing and permits. If you want to do direct sales like door to door sales. And I understand from them that each municipality have different rules and regulations and we need to apply for licenses for every city. Is that correct? I don't know. That's something that we don't handle. Oh, okay. And I would probably call the there should be online services for each municipality and everyone will be different as is the thing. And then you'll simply have to apply for a business license in each of the municipalities. Okay. Right. So you don't do that service of applying business license for like company like us outside. So far too expensive for us to do that. It's not something that we normally do. Okay. And so because every jurisdiction is, you know, every every municipality, every town, every city is different. It requires a fair bit of work. So on those kind of files. We bill at our standard legal billing rate, which is $400 an hour. So it's good. It's, you know, each jurisdiction could take five hours. And so most people find it's hard to expensive to hire us at our legal rate. Right. Take care of those types of when. Okay. And the other thing too is generally speaking with those type of licenses. They require a whole bunch of information that only the company themselves know. Okay. The best way to apply is for you to handle that directly in house. Okay. That is your suggestion. That's my suggestion only because it'd be far too expensive. I unless you've got that kind of, yeah, I'm guessing it'd be far too expensive to hire us to do it. Right. Okay. Anderson. Anyway, I just thought to ask you if you're doing that service. Well, because I don't want to, you know, hire another one and you know, pay separately for this on an annual return, filing of annual return at the same time. This business license application. But anyway, thank you, team. I'll get back to you with a field out for. Okay. Wonderful. Thank you, Jim. Have a good day. You too. Bye.

Hi, my name is Walter and someone tried to call me from your office because I tried to connect you about the air collision pump and I have two rooms on the second floor and it is very hard to find. I was thinking about those split rooms. You say your name is Walter Gustav? That's what he is. That's it? Yes, I know. You are looking for a mini-glass like a dockless heat valve for two rooms in your home? That's right. What do you use for the rest of the house? For the rest of the house, it is a good old house. You have a first house. The house is not for the old house. I have 10 years old. I don't want to switch to heat pump. I need to do something with those two rooms in the second floor because it is getting packed in there. The best solution and the price is how much cost you? Do you have dock work in those two rooms as well? Do you have dock work in those rooms or now? Yes, absolutely. There is nothing there but the other side of the house and probably the air condition is blowing. It is very blowing but still it is very hard to find. I need to do the house like 10 years old, right? The first floor of the temperature is 23 and 25 in the second floor. I have been paying by not putting second floor in there but it is a little late now. I am thinking what is the best way to cool down those two rooms? I get it. For your place, it can be a few solutions. If you have docked heat pump, you can use the upper floor, the two rooms or you can do air docked sealant. Maybe there is something wrong with your dock work and it is not getting pushed to the upper floor properly. If you have docked sealant, you can use the upper floor. Do you have any issues with the upper floor? It is a little bit cooler. You can do the mini-slash that you are talking about or you can get your docked sealant. There is a machine that gets connected to the dock work and it blows the material that feels all the dock work. Any leakages or anything that is actually prevented. You are doing those kinds of services, right? Yes, we do air sealant. I will get both options. I don't need that docked sealant. What is that mini-slash? It is called the docked heat pump and you call it mini-slash as well. It gets mounted to the wall and it does both coolant and heat em. You can use it in summer and winter. The only thing I am a bit concerned with that is the panel box. Every house has a specific capacity for the heat em and coolant. Do you already have a furnace and AC for the whole house? I am going to go to the office and ask for a mini-slash. I will be there to find out if that works or not. I can get back to you quick. I want to make sure it is possible. You can have the AC power for AC as well as for the mini-slash. I want to give you a definition of the docked sealant or a cover. I want to talk to the technician myself. I want to see if it is possible or not. I can give you a price more or less how much that will be. I am not sure if you are aware of it or not. There is government providing interest free funds for homeowners who want to get a heat bump in their home. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat bump in your home at 0% interest rate. If the heat bump is going to cost you 5,000, government will give you that 5,000 at 0% interest rate and you have a period of 10 years to pay it back. That is like one thing. The situation is that I have to disconnect my air condition and start using the pump or how that will work. The first option as you say mini-slash, you will be getting two docked sealant for the upper floor. The AC will be working for the rest of the house. You don't need to get rid of the AC. You can get the information from the home. You can get the information from the home. You can get the information from the home. You can get the information from the home. I have one different number like 905, 564, 3148. What is this one? Is it your work number? That's work. That's my business number. The other one. The other number is 416, 726, 83731. That's correct.

It's like it's an old century. Okay. You can't be real, don't you? How many floors? There's the basement main floor upstairs in an attic. So, four floors? Okay. And what's this core footage of the house? Any idea? No, I'm not too sure. I'm guessing the main floor is probably like 900 square foot. No worries. Not an issue. And do you have a furnace in your home at the moment? Yes, we do. Is that a gas, like natural gas furnace? Yep. And how will it live? It's like 10 years old, something like that. Okay. This is your primary residence and your ABA homeowner, correct? Yes. What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. Monthly, I used to be a duplex, so I kind of got two bills. Kind of distorted. But, guessing year average would probably be 150. So I'm 40. I have no electric cars. Oh, I see. You said the house is like a duplex like Canada? It was. It's being re-converted back into a home. But yeah, it still has a two electrical. Okay. Yeah. For now. Sure. And now we'd have like just a single entry to the house. And that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. And what's the average like gas in bridge rail? Roughly. Um. Average, like one or time we get ridiculous average. I guess it's probably going to be like 180. But that's water and heat. Oh, okay. And water heater. Water heater rental on top of that. Oh, true. Yeah. Okay. Now the email address is to confirm it's C-Grey 1983 at homeale.com. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. The home address is mentioned here only on perio. Can I give the exact address please? No one's going to come to my house. No. No. At the moment. Okay. 64. DK Street. And the E-K-A-Y. Kitchener. Ontario. Yeah. Thank you for that. So Charles, now for the online meeting, I have the availability for tomorrow at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. What's the good time for you? How long will it be, you think? Got to be like 20 to 30 minutes. 6 p.m. will probably be better. That's sure. Let's book 6 p.m. I book you for 6 p.m. tomorrow. I'm going to send you the Google Meet link to your email address tomorrow morning so you can join us at 6 p.m. You can use it in your account or your computer is up to you. One question. Yes. So this program goes through. Are they going to... The ultimate I'm going to be that they have to take my furnace with them. No. Okay. Now your furnace is only 10 years old, do you think, right? Yeah. So if it's like working all good, you have no issues with that. You don't need to get rid of that. You keep your furnace as a backup. That's what I was hoping. Yeah. Yeah. The idea where you want to get rid of my central air. Sure. Because I have central air and senior age. Put lots of sufficient and a heat pump would be. But yeah, heat pumps are very efficient. One is like minus 20 outside. So I would probably want to use my furnace when it was like minus 20 outside, right? Yeah. We also kind of like put the set the heat pump at minus 20. They actually work like till minus 27. But the efficiency drops when it goes beyond minus 20. So we just set it at minus 20. So the heat pump turns off. And then the furnace kicks in when it goes beyond minus 20. Okay. Yeah. Well, the advisor will discuss that with you for sure tomorrow 6am. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

I did know that before it was like it was like a debate. So it is not a debate now? Now the Rebay program it ended on January this year.

You can submit your inquiry at any time using our online form at Vancouver.ca For its slash contact-licensing. Hi, my name is Gina and I'm calling from Ontario. I want to inquire about application for business license and permits. We just give you a background. We are an HVAC company in Ontario and we wanted to expand in BC. What I have right now is we have a statement of registration and certificate of registration. I was called BC Registry and they said that this is not sufficient for us to do direct sales. So what we wanted to do is to do like daughter-girl sales for each VAC unit and this is our kind of business activities. Can you just give me an overview of what needs to be done, what permits or licenses. I need to secure in order for us to move forward. I can only address the city of Vancouver. I'm not sure about the other municipalities. So for the city of Vancouver, you would first need a business license. So just would be filling out the general business license application form. And then on the form you would just describe your business. So for the HVAC, will you have a brick and mortar location that you will be operating out of? So for in Vancouver, within Vancouver. You would have an office. We have, so what are your requirements? So basically this is just, you know, gathering information for us to get an office. We have an address that we still don't have a physical office. But I will, you know, submit me to the direction that you wanted me to, that you're going to say. So your company would most likely need to have, not most likely, will need a business license to work in the city of Vancouver. Okay. And then finally, the contractors, they can either be employees of your company. If that is the case, then they wouldn't need a business license because when they apply, they would be using the company's business license if they need to apply for specific permits. Okay. If I understand it well. So say for example, we have an employee there. We will go into someone who going to work there as an employee like in our payroll. So what does it mean? So I think for city of Vancouver, under HVAC, they may need to get different permits like a mechanical permit or plumbing permit. I don't know the types of jobs that you guys do, but it may be necessary to apply for these additional permits in order to apply for these additional permits, you first must have the business license. Okay. So the first step is to apply for business license. And then? And so because you are out of province, out of the city, you would be applying under the out of town business license category. Out of town? Okay. And I think that just actually just goes under the general business license application process. Okay. I'm on your website and what page are you on? What do you see? Okay. Doing business? Uh-huh. Yep. That's it. Okay. And then under business license and permits. Okay. There's another option of business licenses and for business license. That's correct. This is the first one. Okay. And then, so there are one to three options. Get the business license. This one. Get the business license. And then go down to where it says the steps. Oh, okay. That's calling. I'm sorry. Okay. Step one. Let's be safe to apply. All right. So we are an HRVal company and there's what is the option that I need to choose? They're only cannabis, clothing, film, residential, felicitings, special events, trades and construction. No go down to step four. Okay. Fill out application form and it will be not the home-based one. Okay. It's the one that says, if you click on apply online and then you just start filling out this. Okay. Yeah. I see. So the other thing with HRVal companies here is that there's a company like yourself and then you contract out the work. Yeah. So say for example, the first scenario is to hire someone as an employee and then the other option they're looking at is like to have a subcontractor. So will those subcontractors would need to have their own business licenses? Okay. Like a technician but we still contract the technician. Yeah. So they would need to have a business license license. Okay. So preferably it would be just easier if we hire an employee. Correct? Yeah. That's correct. You have control over everything and the employee and the work and all of that stuff. But the subcontractors, they are their own business so they need to have their own business license. I see. Okay. So other question is, do you require a physical address? Now we have an address but there's no like a physical, like not physical address. But we have an address. Okay. Yeah. That's fine. So if the subcontractors they're working out of their home, like their home is their office address. Okay. But when we have, I'm just saying, but when we send an employee, does that change the scenario? If we never find it. No, because that person is an employee of the company of which the address that you have is the company address. So we have a physical address? No, no. You're in Ontario, you said? Yeah. Yeah. So we have an address. Okay. So as long as we don't need a physical address, I'm fine with that. So business license. And do you know if once after this, do you know how much do I need to pay for a business license or I will just get it from this portal? I think it's on the site. It's not an exact amount because the business license office will review it. So each fact. So there's the application fee that you will pay. And then specifically the license office based on the type of business and that sort of thing they will let you know. Construction. Just looking at some lists here. Yeah, they don't even list the fees even if you see that business license. They may give categories, but the actual license fee is not listed. Okay. You could put it under something like special trades or contractor, special trades or just contractor. So they will let you know what category and the fee. I see. Okay. So once the business license is issued, what will be the next tab? I will apply for the permit. Yeah. Yeah. So once your business license is issued and if the work that you're doing requires another permit, then you would just be using your license number to attach to your application for any type of specific permits like a mechanical permit or plumbing permit. I see. And okay. You know, in Ontario, the door to door sales activity is not allowed. How about in this in Vancouver? Interesting question. One moment, please. Yeah. Thank you. If no sales of any products are permitted. Yep. What you meant? Yes, of course. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing.

I'm going to do a little bit of the same thing. One Cover I'm going to call the Lid. One Cover I'm going to call the Lid. One Cover I'm going to call the Lid. One cover. I'm on call with Chitilfang cover, but I'm on cue. Thank you very much for holding. I have to go through a list of keywords. What you are describing is considered peddling in the city of Vancouver. It looks like it's not permitted, but it's under a bunch of different by-laws. I'm going to have to get clarification from the license office on this one. I'll just describe exactly what you will be doing, and I'll let you know if that's allowed or not. Before I do that, I'm just going to see if I can get an answer from one of my other agents. One moment, please. Actually, I found my answer. So, for it to look like, when you are applying for your business license, you will describe what you will be doing, which is I am an HVAC business that will be doing door-to-door sales. It looks like there is such a license for a peddler, so that's what you would be applying for. There is a license for peddling. Peddling, yes. There are options for the door-to-door sales. There are options that I will click. You will click, but you will describe. There is a section that says, describe your business, and that's where you would write that down. The word peddling needs to be there or door-to-door sales. Okay, fine. Then, probably, I am assuming that our business license were like the activities on that paper that we... That's right, because people here will approach somebody going, do you have a license? Then they would have to give that information, the license number. Okay, that is actually a good news. Can we use the license? I know you are a city of Vancouver. Can we use the license in the nearby city? No, it's a different... It's strictly for the city of Vancouver, because other cities may not allow it, so you would have to check with the nearby cities. I got it. I got it. Okay. If I am going to ask another question about tax-implomatic implications, each other would you be able to answer it or any to call somebody else? Yeah, tax would be under federal jurisdiction. Okay. Okay, so... All right. Thank you so much. That was a very helpful of you. You're welcome. All right, have a great day. Bye-bye. You too, bye-bye.",1177.85387755102,2.378251701884437e-05,1.155051708221436,-1.224154591560364,0.05808275192975998,779.8174149659862,0.1511777777777778,0.4417425925925928

No, I just received it and you're going to get an emailed copy as well. Okay. So then that's good. And then what I'm going to do is I'm just emailing you the. Where is it here? There we go. And when do you think they'll be coming in like when did they start in the morning? I think the dispatch and operations will have to confirm because they have access to all the operations like all their schedules. They'll try to come in. Yeah, they'll probably give you a call today to confirm it. And they usually try to come a bit earlier like, you know, maybe 10, 11 o'clock. Because it's, you know, it's going to take at least between four to six hours, probably longer because you're in the filter and all that. So they'll try to coordinate it a little bit earlier in the day. Okay. Okay. So we can find a place to put the car. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what I'll do now, Brenda, is I'm going to send over the or forward the agreement over to our operations and dispatch team. And then they'll be in touch with you to coordinate the exact day and time. So then that way you can coordinate with them and figure out your car situation so the guys can, you know, take your spot. Okay. I just emailed you. Sorry. Yeah, I didn't pay attention. Okay. A payment of $500. Can I, how do I do it? Can I do it? You just eat transcur for this one. Make it easy because I have no time for the rest of the week. What you can do. This is actually much, much quicker. It's so if you just click on the, the link, you just have to put your credit card. Okay. It's my credit card. And then paypal because I hate paypal. No, no, no, I know I hate paypal. I've had bad experiences at paypal. So no, no, this is your credit card. And we prefer this way. And, you know, we like it because it's a security link through squares. So everything is completely secure. That's why we prefer to do it this way than on the actual agreement with all your information. Yeah. Okay. Update 3810 is not good anymore. I, I was with H, SBC and Royal Bank took it over. So I should have carded change. So I just update. Right. Yeah. Because the rest, the previous one won't work at all. Okay. All right. Oh, it says it's invalid. Maybe I didn't put it in right in the check. Oh, yes. I was dyslexic there. Oh, one of them. Okay. Okay. Does the show it paid? Let me see. What, what, what are you seeing on your end? It says securities deposit. 500 card processing sheet zero sub total 500 order total 500. And I don't see anything else. And you put in your credit card. So I'm going to show you the receipt. Oh, the receipt has been sent. Okay. Okay. Let me quickly check on. I should be able to see it here. Yeah. Yeah. It says completed on my end. Okay. Okay. Show it. Okay. Yeah. No worries. I see it's completed. You should get a copy of our sheet that it's been paid on your end as well. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You have to get going soon. Just super quickly. What I'm going to do is I'm going to forward everything over to our dispatched operations team. They're probably being touched with you. If not today, for sure. For think tomorrow. And again, we'll tentatively book it in from Monday the 27th but they'll 100% come from the day in the time with you. That way you can coordinate with them. In the parking spot with your card. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. I'm going to bring it up. If you don't mind, you can either email me or you can text me on the summer whatever you prefer, whatever is easier. We just usually asked for a couple of pictures. One picture of your panel box. And one or two pictures of your furnace. That way I forwarded over to my team. And just so they can have a super quick look at what you currently have. Make sure they have all the materials when they go there on the 27th. Okay. So yeah, you can email that to me or you can text me on the summer. Operations will probably ask you for that as well, but the sooner you can the better for that. And then that's pretty much it. The team will be in touch to coordinate. Oh, this is what I was going to mention since you're doing up front. And you're going to do cash or certified check. It will be the amount after the deposit, of course. So let's say you're scheduled for the 20th. Do I need to have that for you because I need to go to a bank. My bank. Yeah. The day of the day that they get the book, the info. So let me just. I'll have to scoot out and get something because I won't be around till then. Okay. Yeah. But it's the amount. It's only agreement as well. The amount after the deposit 82, 43, 4. So yeah, if you can just have that one, the guys are there that way after they complete it. So they'll get everything done within the day. Then you can just give it to the guys after the install. Yeah. Okay. All right. We're clashing. So I'm still getting just a request. I haven't got the receipt yet. So you'll make sure it gets for the deposit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let's try. So it should say it's completed on your end. Yeah. Let me look on my end. It says, but it doesn't show any receipt. Okay. Let me check on my end. Maybe it takes maybe it takes a bit of time to receive it. Otherwise, if you don't, I'll get our team to manually send you the receipt. That's not a problem. Okay. Super. Thank you. Okay. No problem. Okay. Thank you. I'll send everything over and our team will be in touch with you either shortly today or tomorrow to confirm everything as well. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. All right, Brenda. Thank you so much. So and you send a document with the breakdown of everything to me. Yeah. You're going to get a copy of the agreement you signed with the with the breakdown of everything. So you'll get that emailed over to you with everything on there as well. Okay. Okay. Okay. Awesome, Brenda. If you have any questions, like I said, please, if you can shoot me an email or text of your phone, a couple pictures of the furnace and the panel box. Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. And then, like I said, this is my direct line. You can reach any time. Otherwise, our operations and dispatch team will be in touch with you very soon as well. And if I send the pictures to this direct line. Yeah. You can text it over to me. Okay. I'll forward it over to the team. Okay. Thanks. Thank you so much, Brenda. No problem.

As are you putting in Korean or Facebook ad for a hit bump? Yes that's possible. I want to know where I don't remember. Yeah I'm just wondering how much it cost. Sure Gilbert, first of all, I think like we do. Can you say Gilbert Gilbert? Sorry what? My name is Gilbert. Gilbert instead of G, put the G, G. Okay J, okay, Gilbert or Gilbert? Gilbert. Okay, Gilbert. Alright, sure, thank you for letting me know. So first of all, let me let you know a bit about some updates in the market. There used to be a rebate program which has transitioned and at the moment government is offering funds at a 0% interest rate. Did you know about this before? That's for bigger innovation. I know with 10 bridge I could get a rebate on the hit pump but the program is off now. It's over. Yes, true. But however, you can still take the advantage of the interest free fund program in case you qualify. So they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a hit bump installed in your home at your present interest. So that's another incentive program going on which you can definitely take a look into. And that would fit the role of the provincial. Yeah, fit the role. Okay but again, that if I'm not free, it's for low income. Not really. No. It's not based on the income at all. Okay. Yeah. They have a criteria like you should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. It is. And it shouldn't be a new build house because new build houses are not qualified. It hasn't been at least. Not in 2012 building. Oh, awesome. It should have been a new build than any building built today anyway. Okay. And it shouldn't be a condo or a partner that has to be a house. It's a house to a story of. Awesome. And you should be a Canadian citizen or a peer holder with a ferry credit score and that's it. Okay. Now, Joe Bird, Joe Bay, I'm going to set up an online consultation. Sorry, but. Go ahead, sorry. Yeah, no worries. I'm going to set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the prize and the product that we offer. Okay. Okay. Now, your help. And I'm sorry because I remember another one maybe I signed too, but I did to their website and they were like pushing our putting in front, but like insulation, the added. Do you do that? Because we don't need that. Yeah, no, not really. I just got your inquiry for hidden and cool and the heat pump. So we're just going to put it on that. Okay. Okay. And now it's just say it was a bit confusing. So maybe the other one I asked to get some information when I get to their website after I sent my information. It was like, you were showing more like about insulation, the add-in and we don't have an add-in, it's a flat roof. Oh, I see. Okay. No worries. Yeah, it should be good. We're just going to focus on heat pump. Okay. Your house, it's a two-story-solid attached. What's this, Krufford and D.A. It's a semi-detached. D.A. Okay. And what's the house size and the square feet, roughly? I would see 17, 18, 100. Okay. And the square feet with the basement. Okay. With the basement, 2000. Okay. No worries. The HC we have already here is a two-ton. Okay. And do you have a gas furnace in your home? Yes. It's a train. We've been, we changed a few years ago, again with some rebate with the embridge and we got the water tank, change for a tankless one. Okay. Very good. If it's something better than the one we have, I might think about changing it because I have to sum not very satisfying, impressed because the solder, the ID, water tankless. You have hot water right away but that's not true because it comes from the basement. When it comes up, it's always like your 20 or 35 second or it's not that cool. Oh, I see. It's not that quick. Oh, I see. Okay. Sure, we can look into another option if possible. Why not? Now the front end, how old is that? Are you gas furnace? Let me go downstairs to the basement. The day it's marked on the second. Yeah, take your time. 20 or 19. Very good. And this houses your primary residence and you are in the homeowner, correct? Yes, and no more mortgage, everything is fixed. Very good. What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. But now I'm going to take a wall payment for the first time and it's $80. What about your gas, the embridge? Embridge? Give me one second. Yeah. I would say 65. How much do you get the gas for and winters? For me? And winters, how much do you pay for gas? That's on the 12th payment, equal payment. It's an equal payment so you pay monthly... Yeah, 65. 65 throughout year? Okay. Yes. And the electricity is 80, you say it, right? Yes. Okay. Now the email address, what I have here is your last name, your first name at jmail.com. Is that correct? Okay. But I have here like GILBRT. That's the last name. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give it like that. As far as I try to find a way to get people to see my name in French or like you see it with a bear. Oh, I see. I got it. Perfect. And the home address, what I have here, it's only on Perio. Can I get the exact address please? The 2374 thing clear with Avenue. I got it. Perfect. Now, Gilbert, for the online meeting, I do have availability for tomorrow Thursday at 1pm, 2pm, and 5pm.

I thought you put it in for you on a Facebook ad for a heat bump. Yeah. So I did the advertisement that I don't have to pay anything for my pocket, right? Let me check. Oh, it's basically, I say it's just stated in such a sense that there is an incentive program through government that's called as Canada Greener Home Sloan, which is an interest free loan program. And we should get money to put a heat bump in your home and you have a period of 10 years to pay that money back, which is interest free.

I have a natural gas furnace and my air conditioners almost on the brink of being half negative replaced. So I'm kind of thinking doing a heat pump thing for a little extra money and then save on the natural gas part and it might be cheaper, I don't know. Sounds good. Sure. And the front is how old is that one? It was put in in 2000 and four I think. Very good. It's got an event system, it's not an old style with the opportunity, it's got the plastic inlet and outlet. Oh my God. It's working all good. Really? Yep. Awesome. This has your primary residence and your is the homeowner, correct? That's right. Yep. What's the average monthly electricity bill just the rough idea? I think it's about 300, 300 to 700. And what about the gas? The gas can be up to 120, 140 and then from there, like that's for say December January to February and then to drop off to, you know, I don't know. The total thing, I don't know what the gas could be probably, I don't know, probably 1,200 bucks a year for gas. Sure. I got it. First, what I have here is Lauren Funt, Gmail.com, is that correct? Yep. And the home address is mentioned here only on Torio. Can I give you that address please? 841 Denmark Street. How do you sell it? 841 DEN, M-A-R-K. Sorry, Nia? Sorry, Nia, hello. Very good. Now, Lauren, for the online meeting, I do have a availability for tomorrow, tomorrow at 2 PM, 5 PM and 6 PM. What time do you prefer? I don't know. I don't like online stuff. We can try it. Like it's kind of like Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. Have you done any Zoom Meet before? Well, I've done it and I don't like it. OK. Because we actually kind of like created a presentation for the heat pump analysis, so we would like to share that with you. And if you are not comfortable, we can look into something over the phone, like a phone call. Yeah, sure. Whatever. That should be good with you. OK. We can try a, like, over the phone meeting, like a phone call tomorrow at 2 PM, 5 PM and 6 PM. Which one do you prefer? 5 PM. Sure. I have a DUN for tomorrow 5 PM. Tomorrow you'll get a call from us at 5 PM. You can just pick it up and have a talk. Sounds good? Sounds good. All right. Thank you for your time, Lauren. Bye-bye now. Take care.

He gave me your number and asked me to call you to talk to you about his name. Yes. Very good. So Deb, first of all, I'd like to let you know about some updates on the market. There used to be a rebate program which ended on January this year. However, at the moment, government is offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. It means that if you guys qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump in your home at zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? Is that through the greener homes grant? Yes. It's from Canada greener homes. We're already getting the greener homes grant. We already have it in place. I'll perfect. I just have to update our information and then our first payment will be processed. Awesome. Oh, yeah. I now remember I got a bat memory. Kurt did tell me this yesterday. He said you guys are already in the process. My bad. I just talked about it. Oh, look at you. Okay. We've already had our evaluation and everything. The company that we have in right now doing the windows, the doors, the roof and the installation. They're not willing to do the pump. Sure. Now we did put that into our claim because they were meant to be doing it, but they've decided they're not wanting to do it now. We're not an issue. We can definitely help you with that. So tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? 1873. Is it a bungalow or a two story? It's a two story. What's the house size and the square feet like roughly? 2700 square feet. Do you guys have a furnace at the moment? Yes, we do. It's brand new. It was replaced two years ago. Very good. It's the natural gas or propane. Yes, natural gas. This house is your primary residence and you guys are in the owner, right? Yes, correct. Yes. What's the average monthly electricity and gas bill? Just a rough idea. In the summer or the winter? In the summer for like average, like annually, how much do you pay for electricity and gas? I would say in the area of our hydro bill runs us anywhere between $200 and $300 a month. What about gas? Our gas bill in the winter season right now runs us about 4 to 600 a month and in the summer it runs us in the area of 100. Okay, perfect. I got a shirt from October to February. We're running anywhere between $400 and $600 a month. So the cost that was six months at that rate. Okay, I got it. Okay. Now the email address just to confirm I have a K-beard 888-hotmail.com. That correct? I don't know if Kurt has that. I've never heard of that email address. How can I get another one then? Sure, I can give you my email address. It's fine. Okay, so it's DMCB1970 at hotmail.com. I have a huge cold right now. Oh, it's okay. Sure. It's D for DAB, M for Mother, C and D for DAB again. No, DAB. BNBOP. Okay, got it. That one I would confuse the best shirt. Okay, I got it. 1970 at hotmail.com. Correct. That is correct. Awesome. And the home address, what I have here, it's only on Perio. Can I give you the exact address please? 350-350 and it's Glen Meyer, G-L-E-N and the second word is M-E-Y-E-R, Road. And that is in Langston, Ontario. All right. Thank you so much for that.

Yeah it's for heat and that cool end like it does build heat and then cool end. The heat pump. Yeah I was just inquiring you know how much those are and you know and I have an old air conditioning unit right now and an old furnace so like it's 27 years old. Hello sure. First of all I just like to lay and know about some updates in the market like there used to be a rebate program which actually ended on January this year. However at the moment government is offering funds at their percent interest rate which means that if you qualify government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at their percent interest. Did you know about this before? No but I need to know if the heat pump would work with the existing system we have. Sure you said you have furnace at the moment right? Furnace and air conditioner. Yeah now when you get a heat pump then you only keep in your furnace at the back of heat system because you don't need to get rid of it as long as it's working good like if you have any complaints or it's broken then that's another case but if your furnace is working all good you keep it at the back up because the heat pump it has an outdoor unit which is going to be outside of your home and an indoor unit which gets connected to the furnace. Okay now as long as the air condition is concerned you don't need to you know you don't need the air condition when you have a heat pump for places that AC. How do I see? Yeah because it does like both coolant and heat in with the heat and it needs the back up so that's why you keep your furnace has the back up only for days when it's like very cold outside like the L-25-30 you know. Okay yeah. Okay I don't really know much about heat pumps so I'm going to have to inquire I have some friends in the business and I'll inquire with them before I make any kind of decisions even for you guys to come and have a look. Absolutely. So can you call me back in probably next week so I can make some inquiries about it? Absolutely I can definitely get back to you next week. And how much is it? Yes.

Cold weather heat pumps, something that will be, I guess, 300 or 300, whatever the efficiency is, typically 300 to 400% efficient down at negative temperatures. And then I guess they'll still work at negative 30 if it's a cold weather heat pump. Yeah. So we're going to go to the way down to minus 30 at a high efficiency, which is pretty good. Like we carry two type of brands. We carry Bladex, which is our competitive like standard package. And we carry green or tauta for premium. They're both really good. They both have the same, almost same efficiency levels. And they both have the same temperature levels. The only main difference between the pricing is because one is known within Canada. It's more like a national brand, which is the Bladex. It agrees more known into national. That's why it's a little bit more because how big is your home? Well, I would be looking, my home is 1200 square feet. So the problem is for heating 1.5 to ton, perfect. But for cooling, I want like three times, right? Or vice versa, I apologize, vice versa. For cooling, 1.5 ton to ton is fantastic. But for heating, obviously you want bigger is better because for obvious reasons, efficiency, a three ton would be fantastic. And from what I understand, most all heat pumps these days are DC variable speeds, right? Yes. So then that would mean that a three ton could run at 30% and cool 1200 square foot without any problems, freezes up or anything like that, right? I mean, there's never an issue going up a bit bigger. I'm glad that you get it because most of our customers, they compare it to an AC only. So they always go smaller. For you in your case, honestly, two and a half to three is a sweet spot there. Like it's good. The main thing in this would be more like a technician question is making sure that the coil fits pretty much in your system to not damage it. That's all it is. But the difference between two and a half and three is not much to be honest. So I don't see the problem there like causing any issues to your home. So if that's really important. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Well, it's not like a three ton is way more expensive than two ton or I mean, they're all that's pretty much the same price. So that's that's that's the good news. So what I did know notice is LG was offering interestingly, you said blade X because I think that's midi, right? Medea media, yeah, they're manufactured by media. Yeah. I mean, from my research, over 80% of all heat pumps in the world are either gray or media. Yep. So, I mean, the technology has only come so far and it's not like one is better than the other in such a significant way that it makes a difference, right? No, it truly is not like all it is is like all this big brands like you know, this big manufacturers, they produce a lot and then different companies just love their brand in it. But at the end of the day, they're all very similar. Yeah. So the blade X has been around for three years and it was I think founded and was built in Markham. So it's like a more like a national brand. And from what I understand, there's a couple different models of the blade X. Yes, there's two. Yep. There's like one that's not cold leather and one that's cold leather essentially. Yeah, there's one that is minus 15 and the other one is minus 30. We did have the option of providing the minus 15 one, but we decided not to just because in the long run, it just gives headaches. It's going to kind of come back to us when people, you know, are complaining one thing and then complain. So we decided that it's not worth it just to sell like a cheaper heat pump, like a no cheaper, but like, you know, like lower price heat pump for to get more sales. We decided to just provide the blade X, the cold climate one minus 30 only. And then this is why I spoke to you about that because the LG home comfort offered 39, 99 installed and then they quoted me a blade X and then somebody else quoted me a blade X and they were much more money. And I was like, well, what's the difference? And then I had to actually get into the model number to confirm that it is in fact different, which you've just confirmed yet again, you know, two different models, same brand name. Yeah. So weeks ago, I had that scenario three times where I quoted somebody something and they were like, oh, I just got quoted from somebody I was like $1,500 less, $1,000 less, $1,500 less for the blade X. And I told them double check with them to make sure there's a sign model just because I know that blade X has two models and I send them to blade X website and ones that confirm it, they actually came back to us. So I'm glad that you actually look into it and got different opinions, you know. Yeah, I'm definitely doing my research on this and I don't want to be stuck with a lemon because there's a number of people that I have heard from and know that they basically got screwed. You know, like you said, they expect one thing, but then it doesn't deliver and they're like, what the hell? The biggest problem even back with the rebate is that a lot of people were promised that they were going to receive it and the equipment that they got installed, they're not even qualified for the rebate. So they're still waiting for their money and most likely, I'm not even going to receive it. That's just the same part about the industry. So yeah, the industry can definitely be shady. Aggressive. Yeah. Let's call it aggressive. Okay. We'll go with the politically correct term aggressive. So what I'm looking for me, so I ended up getting an LG, like I said, 35, 99 was for the heat pump that isn't really worth it in Canada and then they went to 45, 99 for the other heat pump by BladeX, which was, I'm told, the negative 30 and they're saying that, and I looked it up, it seems to be that they're 350% efficient at negative seven and then they drop off from there and then they're 100% efficient at negative 30, which is just a heat strip that's installed. Yeah. Like, would you call it inductive heat, or they just heat up some heat strips and it's just 100%, which is twice as much as gas at that point, right? Because gas is like 96% efficient, but cost wise, gas is three times cheaper right now than electricity. Yeah, I'm following you. So what I'm obviously, what's your, what's your install cost in Hamilton for a standalone BladeX, the negative 30 heat pump with, I guess, everything installed the ECOB thermostat or something like it. I think there's three different thermostats that are with us. That would provide us ECOB Nests. Right. Whether, whether, whether, or in the smart. Yeah. Let me see if what you're looking for the three times you said, right? Yeah. And what's your, just to know how far you are, what's your address in Hamilton? I'm directly on the mountain. What the hell is the address here? He said, he said, uh, Pocicles L8B 3J2 is the specific L8. L8? Yeah. V3J2. And is that B for Victor of B for Bob? V. Vicky. Vicky, perfect. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. V. So the LG Home Comfort was the 4599 and then it had the ECOB and then it, you know, included the line set installation, the pad where the outdoor unit would sit on or the stand, I mean, it had to be from Snowstand thing. Basically, everything included. What? All. What type of warranty did it give you? Thank you. But one year. One year labor. One year labor. One year labor. Ten years labor. Ten years labor. Ten years labor. One year labor. Ten years. Ten years. Ten years. Ten years. Ten years labor. Ten years. That obviously you can claim. And then yeah, one year labor. And they did offer ten years labor and I could pay that yearly for twenty nineteen ninety nine a month, a nineteen ninety nine a year. For every year to extend the labor warranty. So it ended up for how many years? Up to 10 years for $20 or $19. Yeah, to match the parts, warranty. But you had to pay extra. 19. And you had to pay it every year. Perfect, so that was heat pump, the coil, you got the thermostat and the warranty. And how much you said they quoted you for? The snow stand, the line sets, they're included all the things for $45.99 for the third negative 31. And it was $35.99 for the cheaper one. So $1000, there are more than a thousand bucks. Yeah, a thousand bucks. The best thing that I can do to my end is run it by my managers because to be open with you, our prices are a little bit more than that. What would be me? For us right now, after taxes, our price is $59.32. For the grand, yes, almost $6 grand, yeah. But I mean, we do have a best price policy, which means that, you know, since you already got a quote, do you got a writing or did he give you a call in writing or did he just set it? I have to add text message. I have to copy the text message maybe. Hopefully it's still there. I have a racing message is, let's see, 30. I can also call them back, right? 36, or sorry, 4,600. There's almost something you have in AC right now, right? I currently have an AC. I have a six-year-old dyke and it's two-ton and it's rated at seven, well, it says that it can do up to sear 24, but it's actually sear 17. So they kind of jiggy the number, right? Oh, maximum efficiency, sear 24, but the reality is 17. Like in the best possible conditions, you will get sear 17, but, you know, generally speaking, sear 17 is what they do. That the model has got 17 in it as well. So you really have to dig in the paperwork or you get screwed. Spread your name to the age back industry. Yeah, it really is, you know, aggressive. And it's perfect. So what I can do on my end is like, I can give you my email because I don't like to be honest. That quote is pretty good. I don't want to waste your guys time. If I could match it or beat it, it would be like 10%. Not just by a couple of, you know, like 20, 30, 50 bucks because honestly, that would not be worth your time. If we do end up coming below of it, it would be 10% that we're going to beat it. I just personally cannot approve it right away. I would have to run it by my, but you know, the senior guys and the team. But yeah, if you can, I can give you my email. And if you can get me that in writing, I would forward it to them and give you a call back. In fact, I'm just looking through my text messages now and they advertise it. They advertise both price. They advertise. Yeah, they've, so I ended up getting, I ended up getting the quote from their advertisement from Facebook. And then I pushed the button like I did with you, right? And then put in my information and then somebody called me. And it was, it was the advertisement on Facebook. Apparently, they were saying, giving away a heap of pumps at a low cost because the government granted and basically all heap of sales robbed. Like 80%. And they were just trying to get rid of stock is what the advertisement was. No, it is the rebate that ended in February, but they're coming back on June. Do you know what the rebate will be in June? The rebate on June is going to be a sort of Fisher yet, but they do have, I think they already approved it. The rebate will be, it's not going to be as much as before, but it's still a little bit of help is 250 per ton. So we're looking at for a three ton, you're looking at about 1500 that they're going to be able to cover. Wow. And it was 6000 before. Yeah, before the year. Yeah, before I got ridiculous though, because the heap of pumps were covering $6,000 of it. Some people double their prices. So make like a lot more money out of it. And I called the wholesaler down on Woodward Ave, the HVAC Holes. I'm a millerite by trade. So I'm a tradesman, so I get, I can buy anywhere, like I can buy at a plumbing store. I can buy HVAC equipment. I think it was like $400 or $500 for the EVA. And then it was 2100 or 1900 depending on which one was like 2 grand. So in total, it was like 20, 2400 to 3200 for the equipment. And then to charge 6 grand, it's like you get 6 grand to come in and put in an EVA coil. So you know what I mean? So people were really raking money. Yep. Yep. Yep. So, and then I know that I looked into LG Comfort home and they were actually buying a high quantity of heap pumps so that it could get it at a much better price. They ended up paying like $1,200 for the condenser and you know $200 for the EVA. And I was like holy crap. They went all in and then the government went stupid and changed the rules and then the average candidate in January and it was like holy shit. They got screwed. Now they're trying to get as many inventory as they can, no make sense. That's why, yeah, it is for me, I try to do my homework and get the best product for the best price, right? Yep. So I kind of know what being paid for these things and usually I'm hoping that people work with me. At the end of the day, theoretically, the line sets already there, the EVA is already there. You know what I mean? Yeah. But in any case, it's not a lot of work to pull out the EVA. It's just that the trunk, right? And mine is easy access. And my line set is I think 8 feet. So it makes life so much easier. Everything's easy to get at. Probably be a two hour job. So to make, you know, if you send two guys, which normally people do for an hour travel back and forth, half a day's work. You know what I mean? Yeah. Everybody's got to make money. No, they're being, if that's their price, they'll be honest, they're being very aggressive. That's pretty good. Pretty sure it's because they bought a whole bunch. Yeah. Like to kind of like keep up with demand because I've been told by salesmen that the demand was really high near the end when they started to allow standalone heat pumps instead of buying whole systems. Yeah. So that's kind of what we're doing with air conditioners. We should have a couple of them stock because people like don't really look for them anymore. We're letting them go at a very low price. But the heat pump thing is people got to grow a little bit of love with after the government of the rebate because the demand came down. Even us, we have to adjust our approach. I still did pretty well with the heat pumps because of the other face, it makes sense for people. But it definitely saw the volume going down versus before, you know. Yeah. Yeah, I definitely understand now. Just so that we're clear and I want to tell you this piece of information. I got my home assessment. I booked it the day before it closed the deal closed the day before and bridge shut it shut down. Okay. I got it the day before I've got the appointment the day before and then January 20th. It was end of January. I ended up getting the home evaluation and I'm locked in until 2027 for the rebate. I decided to, because I saw, I thought coming, I decided to, I decided to hold off regardless of what salesmen were telling me get it now. Get it now. Before it's gone. I'm like, no, no, no, no. It's going to be gone and it's going to be stuck with heat pump and they're going to want to clear them out. So I'm going to get it for a lot cheaper. And that's why it's in my best interest to have waited and whatever it is. I get full six grand credit, but I want to, I want to cash back. Like you can buy my old air conditioner for X amount of dollars or some, however you want to work it on your book. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's, that's what I, and I know this business is aggressive. That was the right word, wasn't it? There it was. So I know, I know that's, I know that's totally doable for the cash back. So you give me a receipt for the sixth grand and I pay, you know, whatever the 45 plus the tax or whatever it was, which is like five grand, 5100 or something like that, right? So, you know, it was before tax. The 40, the 4599 was before tax. Yeah. So 5100. After tax, which would have, would give me about which gives me $800 cash back. Plus I get to recoup the money for the actual assessment. Which in order to get an assessment as quick as I did, because I knew it was going to never going to start up again. I ended up paying, I think it was 900 or it was $100 more than they gave you cash cash for. You know what I mean? Yeah, because the use of cover, I think it was like 600 and the out at our 750. I think the end of 100 something like that. I think I ended up paying like 8800 or I think it was 800 then. It must have been around 800. It was probably around the 800 because that's how much it is after tax is for us. Because at the end of the day, I needed that audit right away. They were saying after they shut it down mid-January, they were saying, oh, you'll have till end of February to get it done. Your assessment, I'm like, can't bullshit. So I ended up getting it done as soon as possible. It paid an extra 100 bucks for that. And lo and behold, February 2nd done. It was like, son of a bitch, he fucking government. Endbridge screwed a lot of people on that one. The government screwed Endbridge and an endbridge screwed everybody else. That's true. So what I can do is I can ask them those two questions. One, if we can match that price or beat it. And number two, if we do have that option of the cash back. Yeah, or buy my old air conditioner for a thousand bucks or something like that. That looks a normal on paperwork. We might not do that just because we provide new equipment. We don't do use. I know for sure that they probably won't do that. But I can, I mean, we can just steal this pose for you. If it's too old, if you still want to keep it and sell it to somebody else, you could definitely do that. But I can't check with them and ask them those two questions and get back to you within 30 minutes. What was your timeline to get this done? If you had everything good to go, I'm ready to do it pretty much any time. Perfect. And will you be handling that out? Do you have the information or whoever they'd be out of for you? Of course, yeah. Yeah. Okay, that was good. Because what you can do is either on your own or my team can contact them as well. So after it gets installed, they can do the second one. And then you can receive that. You can receive that grant. I think it comes 10 days after. It's pretty quick. It's not too bad. The grant, the grant, a year-weight minimum. And the grant. So first of all, I'm going to be doing some insulation on the roof. I'm doing my roof as well. And I'm going to get the, that basically tops it up to the 10 grand that you're allowed from the, through the rebate. And so once I do the roof, then I'll have the audit guy come, he'll go ahead and approve all those two things. And then they send it to the government. I'm either half the audit people, the company. And the wait time is the last I heard was a year before the guy gives you to get the grant. Yeah. Yeah, like to be given the money is a year. So, so yeah, that's significant. And I've also applied for that $45,000 interest tree loan for 10 years. And I've been approved for that. So I'm taking advantage of everything the government has to offer right now. I mean, why not? It's free money. I mean, well, it's definitely, it's good to have $45,000. You have to get approved and you have to, we had to jump a bunch of hoops to do it. It's not easy. And you know, you got to, you got to be aggressive when you, when you're, when you're dealing with that sort of thing. You got both, you got the grant and the loan. That's pretty good. Yeah, they give you the loan as long as you can prove that what you're going to do for it and then give receipts for the stuff that you've spent. Yeah, they give you the, so hey, no problem. You know what I mean? I'll take advantage of it. I'll definitely use it because no interest on $45,000 for 10 years. Okay. I'll, I'll take your $45,000 for, you know, for free for, for 10 years. The only problem is they attach it to your house. They put a lien on your home. So if you want to sell the house, you got to pay off the, the grant. The government puts the lien on the home through the CRA, but you never see it on your title. They said, it's just through the CRA. They put the lien. Anyway, yeah, get back to me. Let me know. I anticipate spending in total once the government extortion fees are kicked in and everything around $5,000. So I'm looking for a $6,000 receipt and paying five grand. That would, that would be what I'm looking for with the Beledex negative 30. Full receipts when you get here to install the things before you start disconnecting the ASEAN and doing the work. Full receipt before, like when you show up with all the equipment ready to go. Yeah. I definitely don't want, I definitely don't want the air conditioner uninstalled and the system drained. And then you guys say, oh, sorry, we can't give you that. You know what I'm saying? Of course. Let me let me send you my email through text. What else was there? Yeah. I missed that in everything's installed one year warranty. Yeah, warranty on labor. That's that's like, oh, I think I just got your text. I just heard a text. Come in. I just send you my email. Let me talk to my manager about the price and then let me get back to you. Sounds good. Sounds good. Talk to you soon. Yep.

It says, please hold and give me music. Oh, I did. I'm going to have to double check back. This is my bestness number. I have to double check that. Sorry about that. Yeah. No worries, no worries. Perfect. So you said that you don't have a chance to join the meeting. Right? You just wanted to talk over the phone. Sorry. What was that? Perfect. Do you receive the link for the meeting or no? No. Is there something to show? Usually we show everything. But I mean at the end of the day, what was the main goal for the heat pump? Because I'm seeing here the notes. And it looks like your AC is broken at the moment. Yeah, he's not working properly. So I need to place it. My fitness is about four years old. And it's high efficiency, multi-stage, variable speed. So that's fine. It's just the AC. So I'm actually looking at the option of heat pump. What does it say? So the thing is there are no rebates. So they're here, right? And the same change. The rebates are not. They're not. They got rid of them in February. So it's been the rebate's been offered a little bit now. Yeah. So that's gone. I didn't that. What would you suggest? Heat pump was the AC for here. Me personally in the long run. I feel like the heat pump is more worth it. Just because at the beginning, yeah, it might cost you a little bit more. But in the long run, like, you know, even though your furnace is still high, efficiency is still relies on gas. Yeah, the gas is cheaper. Gas, it depends, right? Because sometimes like gas, for example, with the carbon tax inflation, everything, I have seen people like bills going, keep getting higher and higher every year. So based on how much you're spending on gas and everything, the savings that we have here that you were expected to get is about 105. I mean, at the end of the day, the heat pump at the AC is going to raise your electricity cost like regardless of it. Both of them are going to do that. Right. Heat pump is going to raise it slightly more than the AC, but it's going to save you a lot more on gas. Yeah, this is an offset that the argument that I hear is going to save. But the thing is with the extreme ventures, the way heat pump is going to use the electricity, it's not, I don't know if it's really a bird, he's saving the nap, and electricity is more expensive. So the argument goes both ways, maybe a little bit, but what I was trying to get, because if you have longer summers, by all means, I think heat pump, that's what I read about it. And correct if I'm mistaken here. But if you have like few months of summer, then it's good because they are more efficient than the actual AC. And with the very mild winter, they can do the job that's great. Then you don't need to like furnace and AC. But here we have a short summer, maximum of three months of AC use. And that's where it is. So AC versus heat pump, both the pi-steffants, I mean if they pi-steffants not much, then yeah, by all means they are better. But if the pi-steffants is huge, then I've done something that I have to decide. I mean, yeah, I have furnace and fuel, two, three months of summer, that we really need the AC. How much difference is going to make? You know all that, because both prices increase, electricity increases every year, too. And so does the gas. And it's just a calculation how you use it. So that's what it is. So what's the difference? That's what I was trying to get to the understanding of the pricing. Because of your home, because you are at 3,500 square footage, what size have you been getting for the heat pump? Because I have you here between a three and a half and a five ton. Right. So basically I've been getting clean and I have to four. My current AC is 10 and a half ton carrier. And that was doing fine job, but four ton would do for the heat pump. I was told four pumps would be better. At least you know, four pumps. 10 and a half is a little, you know, it can do the job, but four ton would be better. Yes, it definitely will. Here, let me just take a look. So the price that I have, yeah, go ahead. Now I was going to say because I do have the price of the heat pump in front of me. The AC, we do have someone stock, but we haven't done AC in a long time. So I would have to get the price of those. I'm sure my guy probably wants to get rid of them. So he will probably give a good deal for us. So I would have to get more details in those so I can give you a call back or send you an email with the both of them. When it comes to the heat pump, the heat pump that I have here for you. The price is a 60, 200 after tax, so 6, 271. That's what the heat pump, the coil, the thermostat, the warranty, and full installation. So that's the full cause of it. Okay. Okay. That's really high. Which one is it? It's the BladeX. BladeX. Okay. Oh, okay. I'll leave it to that for BladeX. That's by Ermedie. Ermedie, whatever it's called, company. BladeX is manufactured by media, which media manufacturers like a larger model of the pump. How long has been BladeX in the business? Three years. They're actually a Canadian company. They've funded in Markham. They have done extremely well, but the reason why the price is a little bit less than, you know, like the toss-ups, the grease, the mischievous. It's because they are only known in, like, pretty much national wide within Canada. The older brands are more known internationally. That's why the older ones cost a bit more. But BladeX has done extremely well. And all the units that we carry is their old coal climates, which they go down to minus 30. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And let's take the AC part. It's because the price of the AC and this is quite a bit of difference. The way I think I've seen it's a significant difference. I may have to... Let's take the price of the AC. Let's say this way. Let me give me a minute. If I cannot get it moving in the next minute, I'll let you know when I send it to you in the email. Sure. Or you're back. Give me one sec. Yeah. Text me, even if you send me new email, text me as well. Because I need to make it this way. I'll go into the direction I'm going to go to. If it makes more forward with it. So once you get it, this text me. Yeah. I'll take the email, even if you send the email, that's fine. But just text me. No problem. Let me call you back in two minutes. Okay. Bye bye.

And someone from the finance department called me that you have not market completed as well. We will send you a legal notice. And she was talking to me in a very good way. I said, no, you.

But they never sent it. They also told me that they will send me covers for the black wiring. They will send me white covers for black wiring. They never sent it.

You can see all of that. But then. Yeah, it does that pre sales know they are calling me so many times, but after the yes, I have marked it is completed. They just disappeared in premier or.

And also, also, also, there is a little bit like our incandescent is not on the right place. So we just want to move the heat pump about four feet away from there. Yeah, you can let it technician off for sure. Okay. Okay, cool. Okay, so what I'm going to do now is because the thing for the, for the tank, for the tank thing, I'm going to send you the form. We can try to negotiate for you on that end. But one of the things in order to add it to the financing part is that we, you would have to pay them. First, just like I'm it did and then chose the invoice and then we will be able to add it for you. Okay. But, but you know what like Alex, I didn't pay anything to them. They add automatically on my bill. Did they pay anything to audit guy? No, they they are the after. Yeah, yeah, the audit is fine. I'm talking about the tank, the tank of bio. By, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I was just, I was just talking about the bio. Yeah, yeah, by out we will, you just after you install it, same thing you send him the money and he will pay them. That's okay. Perfect. Perfect. So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to do the, I'm going to build the, I feel like the first, the first thing to do is finding out about how much the bio is exactly and trying to see if we can negotiate with the tank. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to send you the form. I'm going to be sending you the form so you can fill it up and send it back to us. So my guys can start looking at it. At the same time, I'm going to figure it out with the team to build up today. The agreement, the deposit with the outer and everything send everything to you.

We will be able to release the funds for the, you know, for the tank listing. But I believe in a air can get Amy to call you guys to explain it better. Because she's the one who deals with that. But I believe you might have to pay first, have the invoice and then they will give you guys the money. For the, for the buyout for the buyout. Yes. Yeah, yeah. The buyout, buyout actually, you know what? Like when they send us bill. So it's take time to get the bill towards because we need to be canceled with them. We call them and you need to cancel them and they cancel it and they can you the email. And then they take up 30 days or 40 days to send you the final bill. Yeah, whenever, whenever you get the final bill and you pay it off on the on our end, they can give you the funds. That's not a problem. I can get Amy. Let's get Amy to call you guys and explain that part better. Because she's the one who you know that actually does it. Let me do the agreement first, ship it over. And then are you guys able to find out on your end as well? How much you guys the thing is? Yeah, we knew it's about $4,100 including tax, I believe. And I see. Tax include.

20240524-172024_2282_+14168342637_Outgoing_Auto_2198321898042.mp3," Hello. Hey, this is me. This is Amit. Yeah. Hey, I'm Amit. I'm Alex, the guy from Weaver about the hip-hop. Your brother told me to give you a call and are you able to add him? I am here. I'm here, we need him. Oh, you're here already? Okay, perfect. How's it going guys? I'm good. Thank you. Awesome. So, Amit, tell me. What's the case in your house? What were you looking to change? All the things that my brother did that. Okay, so the hip-hop is the number one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What would I use? He mentioned that you have a tank right now. Yes. And you want to go tankless. Yes. Yes. But, but, but, but Alex, you tell him with the tankless. Not going to be zero percent. You tell him everything. You tell him everything. Why out we will do it, but the tankless unit will explain his first. Yes, so the tankless. The tankless essentially is no part of the zero percent loan. So, what we do for the tankless is we still can offer you the option for the financing at 0.99%. Because the other thing that you could take advantage of the tank of the zero percent is the government has approved a hip-hop water tank. What would you? It's going to be another tank, but it's a lot more efficient than a gas or electric water tank. So, it's going to be able to give you more savings. The only difference is that you're still going to get a tank in return, but it's a hip-hop water tank. And it does qualify for the loan. Me personally, I would recommend you to do that just because you don't have to pay interest on it. And it's still more efficient, even more efficient than a tankless. But the problem is this. I don't, there is a basement with my house is a smaller house. I've come to my house, the buzzer house. My house is at 2443, clear feet. Yeah. I meet the renovated basement. And I meet the space for the basement because the tank left like a tank is covering all the space. So that's why you were thinking of doing tankless, right? That's correct. I mean, we can see you do the tankless. The only difference it would be that you would just pay 7.99 per cent of interest rate on it. How much are you paying on gas right now? I have no good position. Is your tank that you have right now gas or electric? Gas. If gas, right? Okay. Yes. And then he mentioned something also about the bio. Yes. How long have you been with them? 2018. So that's only six years, right? That's correct. And besides that tank, do you have any, is that with reliance? Reliance? No. In a care. Do you have any idea how much it is? Rento. How much are you paying right now on rental? I believe it was 4,000, okay. It's $1,000. No, no, no. The bio. Bio is 4,000 I believe. Yes. I'm going to have to send you the. Pretty much the sheet for the bio for the contract for any care. So you can fill it and send it back to us and we can call them. And see if we can negotiate something on your behalf. So we're looking at a 2500 score footage home up to. We have a heap of. We have a tank list. See what the bio option is. Okay. Perfect. So what I'm going to do right now is I'm going to build up a quote that I'm going to be. Can I get your email? You can start with my brother too. But I'm going to give you my email address as well. I can do both. I can do both for sure. Yeah, mix. So I'm. Each. And. Yeah. Dot S. Dot. Yeah. My. Yeah. A. A. A. A. Okay. So I'm going to send you and send your brother. Abmed. How about that? And how many showers is in your home? Right now three. And supposed to be. It's going to be. Hmm. The basement. Right now three. Probably it's going to be four. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is. I'm going to build up the agreement. Not agreement. Like just like a quote. Uh, forward. You both. So you can see the total cost of everything. And show you what the option for the financial side is. Uh, is that home your primary home. Yes. And are you the owner of it? Yes. Perfect. So the for the out it will be the same thing for the year percent loans. It will be this sumptum similar. We're going to add the cost of the outed as well to it the 750 dollars. I'm going to do right now, Mirza, I'm going to put everything together and forward to both of you guys. So you could see it. I'm going to see what my colleague, what my supervisor says about the bio and get back to you on that, okay? Okay. No problem. Give me about 20 minutes and you should receive that and I'm going to give you a callback for confirmation that we were able to do it or not. Yeah, Alex, please. I have about six my family member, real family member. We need to do the same thing what we've done for myself. Six of them. Yeah, I'm going to do one this one, one my White House, which one I tell you and two my sister house. Four house. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Let me. And how much the heat pump for my brother house? How much is my mind is bigger and he's a small one right? For his is three ton for his would be 52 to 50. So it's about almost $300 less. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Give me one. Thank you. Give me one second. Bye bye. I'll be back to you guys. Bye. Yeah.

So I just wanted to give you the the price you were asking for the daykin. Yeah. So let me just pull it up because they got back to me here. So we were looking at, I'm just trying to pull up the original email that I sent for the good the Goodman, rather a three-head system, which is 36,000 BTU or if we switch it over to the two-head system, still 36,000, it's the same unit. Right. So that one was 11, 250 plus HSP. The daykin. Sorry. Yep, go ahead, sorry. Oh, sorry. Okay, sorry. You cut out there. So yeah, so the daykin won the original price, I'm actually that they gave me was 12.8. So that's the price difference, but I can bring it down if you were looking to pay it up front. Still go with the incentive program, but pay it up front because that's the invoice that needs to be submitted. I can bring it down to 12 even. Okay, and that's install on everything, right? That's install warranty of the all-in. Yeah. Okay. Would you be able to send me the information? Yep, sure. So what on I do this because we have been going back and forth quite a bit, and I know you know you're still trying to figure out exactly what you guys want. Do you want it's Friday now? Do you want the weekend to review it and then Monday we can make kind of a final decision because I am also like that discount is kind of coming from me as well. Yeah, management told me 12.8, but you know I'm trying to help you out because we've been going back and forth. Yeah. So do you want to do that or what are you comfortable with I guess? I do have another quote coming in on Monday, so I would prefer a little bit longer, but I mean it's just yeah tough. It's a cool client one, right? Oh yeah, this one is like it's a high like super high efficiency. Okay. And then we could secure you in. Like I mean you're you're in around the right price, so I don't want to say like Monday. Like I don't know I don't know about Monday, but I want to look at the unit. I want to see you know how about we do take the weekend Monday like let's say later in the day, you know I can hold that promotion because I have to let management know that I'm giving that extra discount as well. And then the other thing is we could you know we could go ahead at least to secure in the application for you. So if anything happens and secure an attentive date for the audit, if that's the route you still want to take. Yeah. Is that fair? Yeah. And so Monday if I reach over to like any time after 3 or 4 o'clock or what's your preference? Yeah that's fine. 4 o'clock would be nice. Around 4 o'clock? More time yeah. I've ever been incentive. You said that. What are the rules on that again? Like what can I think are wrong with down here? Let's see. So you have to get the audit done by a licensed auditor three, their embridge or the candidate greeners, which all of the auditors we work with are on the list and approved because not all auditors qualify. Some people don't know that, but so you have to get your audit done. So both audits 700 cover your pre and your post audit. The government funds up to you as well of course. So that's the first thing that we would do is secure in the audit because it is a first come first serve with them and then we would secure in your application of course. So that's you know if anything happens then you're you guys are still good to take advantage of it. And then it's just getting the audit done then getting the work done paid for that's the invoice we're going to I mean our whole project management team is going to walk you guys step by step from A to Z on the application process and all of that. And then you get the work done the invoices submitted the second audit is completed. So that way the same auditor can confirm and checkmark everything's been done by the standard. Once we submit that then the government will send you the full amount including the audit with usually within 10 business days. How long is the full thing like process? The the the the the in like the audit and the in so we can get done you know as soon as possible kind of thing like we can get the audit booked within within I mean two to three days or less than a week kind of thing. We can get the work done you know whenever your preference is. So ours is you know we have technicians and experts all throughout the province. So you know our availability and same with the auditors we would assign a licensed auditor kind of within your area. So we can do everything within less than a week or what your preference is as far as the government incentive. From A to Z it's usually around a six to eight week period on average. Okay that's just for the money to be given right? Yeah like for the the audit application the second audit and then of course the them sending you the the money. Okay but that's basically from the three I'm A to Z like from getting your audit done to getting receiving the funding. Okay. Okay. I am the only one on my house. So it's okay to just have me on there right? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah usually they just only one name is needed like I deal with you know spouses or whatever people that are multiple people in the home but they they prefer to easier for just one name to be listed so that's not an issue. Okay. How is the overall like you said your overall credit standing and all of that is is good right? Mine is good. He's not so much. Yeah they're not going to look at his because it's if your name you said that's on the home right? Yeah. Yeah so we would be putting everything in your name so he wouldn't even be looked at at all. Okay. I mean the approval rate to about 98 percent. I even had one of my clients and I do with my hundreds of clients. I've helped with the loan. I haven't had one client. Not kind of would do want to jinx it but how come back with a decline? I don't know. Sorry what was that? No no no I just like because it's like I don't want to be that one to pick you down. Yeah well well you're seeing your you know what the government with this program surprisingly because it's you know it's quite a bit that they're offering for a long period. They're actually they're actually super lenient. They're even more lenient than our partner financing. Sorry? Oh okay well they should be it's a loan and really when you think about it how much money they're taking on carbon emissions and trying to lower everything so like yeah. So I just got to be going somewhere to help people. True. Yeah yeah. I have heard true. Hey anywhere you can get help especially from the government at this point. You know so but yeah I know they're pretty lenient. Like they're of course I have to say this to everybody there is always that small one percent right but like I said it's I haven't seen it as of yet I hope not too and they are quite lenient with this program as far as approval. Okay. Okay so you're going to give me the models all right. The email. Yeah I can send you the Diken model or brochure or whatever. That's not a problem. That's great. Okay so take the weekend to review it. I feel and then I will touch face to few Monday around four o'clock and you know let's take the next steps from there. Okay so good thank you Mary. Okay little problem. Yeah. Have a good weekend. Bye. You too. Bye. Bye now.

We spoke yesterday about your inquiry for a heat pump. Yes. Yeah, you say you're looking to get like I think two units, that class only for upper floor or specific room. I don't recall. Can you remind me of that? I think, can you remind me that my conversation with you yesterday because I don't recall to. Oh sure. Anyone about my units, you know, my. Okay, you call. I believe you called me yesterday around, I don't know, three or four PM. You said you have a furnace and AC for the rest of for your home, but some portion of your house, I don't know if if if it's not getting enough cool in the heat, but you're looking for a unit that class in there. I wanted to check if your panel box is okay with it or no, I told you I'm gonna call you back. Yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, that's right. That's for now. Now I got I get so many things on my head. Sorry, you know, yeah, that was, yes, yes. So what exactly do you want to know from me? So just want to just tell me a bit about your situation once again. What are you back looking for? Because I figured out your panel box can be still okay and in the incentive can it still be okay for your home if you're looking just for two units for a specific area and not for the whole house that can still work. Yeah, that's right. I mean, because I got a home which is two beds from upstairs and there's some of these, everything's going on, you know, on the first floor and get only one for us and those two rooms upstairs that are getting a heart in there. Yeah, you know, and calls in a windtatch. So, you know, I was thinking, you know, like I was looking at in on a website and there was like a me split unit like a heat. Okay. And I was thinking maybe that will work for me because those two rooms upstairs that they are not, you know, like they are almost up on the other side of the house. So, what do you think? Yeah, I did talk that I did kind of like discuss your situation with the manager yesterday and he said it's all good both with the incentive. Like, you can still qualify for the entrance free funding program. If you want to take get like only two like mini-slads for the per place only that can still work and your panel box be okay too. So, now, while her, what I can do as I can like set up an online consultation with one of her advisors, she will provide you with the prize and the product that we offer. And we'll discuss the funding program with you as well that if you like it, you can go ahead. Okay. Yeah, okay, that will be great because I don't know if that's somewhere congee from your company or somebody else. Really? You know, there was there was pushing for, you know, a pit palm, you know, a rebar, a de pad. You know, I'm ready for that because you know, I don't know how I'm going to lift in just home and and you know, like my phone is between you and my host from my air conditioner. So, I'm not ready to play. Yeah, you don't think too. Yeah. Just the two rooms. Yeah, he was pushing the houses. Yeah, he wasn't, you know, he was pushing like crazy and I said, thank you very much. But, you know, I'm not going to take your offers and if someone is going to call me and talk to me about those two rooms, I'm more than, yeah, I agree with you. Okay. Sure. And your house, like, when was it built? What year? The 1000 was built in the 2013 or 2012, you know. Do you know the current better of the two rooms? Sorry, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. You know, it was built new and those two rooms upstairs and phone is on one side of the house that I condition and those two are a mother house, another side of the house.

20240524-162250_2207_+16477791986_Outgoing_Auto_2198307488042.mp3," Hello here is Cafe. Hello, nice to meet you, Tobbe. I'll say it again. Hi, my name is Tobbe. Tobbe, yes. Hi, this is Hussnell Collin from Weber Eco Home. I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat pump. For what? It's for heat and coolant system. A heat pump. Yeah. So, Tobbe, I'm just reaching out to Layin' about some updates in the market. The previous rebate program, it has transition. And the government is now offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? No, no, no, I don't. No worries. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors. She'll pass this program with you and go through her numbers as well. Okay. Okay. When is the best time to have this? The best time we can do like on Monday at... Monday is good because... 15pm? Okay. All right. So, you're going to send me a link or something? I will. Just quickly tell me a bit about your home. Like when was your house built? What year is the house was built? Probably close to 100 years. I will say 1920. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 100 years. 80, 90, I don't know. It's a bungalow or a two-story. It's a commercial building. Commercial building, like an apartment. We live upstairs and the main floor is a coffee shop. Okay. So, the main floor is a shop. Coffee shop. And on top of the coffee shop, there is the unit at 11, right? I need a unit for the coffee shop and upstairs as well. Okay. Is it like a duplex like two units? One is the coffee shop and the other is the place you live in? It's a storefront, you know? Two stories. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. And how big is the area? Like how big is your home, the one you live in, the unit? 2200 square feet. 1200, the main and the top is 1100. Okay, so 1100 is the one which is the coffee shop and 1100 is the one you live in, right? Yes, yes. Okay. And do you have a furnace in your home? We have a radiator. A radiator, okay. The heat is radiator. But the radiator is for the whole building. Okay. But our main feature we're looking for is the air-conditioned unit as well. Okay. Okay. The good thing is the heat bomb, it does both coolant and heat em. So when you have a heat bomb, you don't need to have an AC. It does coolant in your home and you can use it for heating and the winter. So it does two jobs. Oh, that's wonderful. Yeah. That's ideal, right? Yeah. Now, are you looking to get like heat bomb just for the residential area, the one you live in or also for the coffee shop? I'm looking for the coffee shop as well. Oh, as well. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right now, I have a air-conditioned unit for the coffee shop, but it's a duct. So if I can get this, I don't need the duct. So I can just... Yeah, true. Sure. Okay. And you don't have gas access, right? No gas lines there. I do have a gas line. You have a gas line. Okay. Yeah, the heating is gas and all the cooking is gas. Okay. So the radiator is heated. Like you have like a boiler system kind of thing that provides heat with the radiator. Yes. Okay. Okay. And this is your primary residence and you are the homeowner, CREP. Yeah. We are the home owners who will live upstairs and we run the coffee shop ourselves. Okay. I just need to clarify one thing with my manager. I just need to find out if your place is eligible for the incentives as well or no. Okay. Because the coffee shop is commercial, half is residential. I'm just going to talk to him quick and I'm going to call back you, call you back in the minute or so. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you.

20240524-163209_2207_+14163582911_Outgoing_Auto_2198309933042.mp3," Hi, this is Hussna Colin from Weaver, Icahome. I thought I could create on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Okay, I'm just calling out to Layna about some updates in the market. The pre-3-bay program, it has Transition and the government is now offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? No. No worries. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors. Shielded public program with you and your numbers. Okay. I don't know what you're talking about. Are you talking about the financing or are you talking about the unit itself? Oh, at the moment I'm talking about the incentive programs for kind of the greater homes. Right. Yeah. So this is not replacing anything. It's for a hit bump. Like if you want to get a hit bump in your home, you can qualify for that program, which I just talked about. So what are you exactly looking for? It's, um, it's too, okay. I house just don't have air conditioning. So I was thinking of putting in central air. Okay. So instead I'm thinking of a hit bump. The thing is Virginia's a hit bump. It does both cool and and hit them. So if you have a hit bump, you don't need to have an AC. So it's easy. Yeah. And at the same time, you can be saving on your bills with a hit bump and take advantage of the incentives. But the incentive is to replace old units, right? Not really. It's just like, um, do you have a friend that's in your home now? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So when you get a hit bump, it will be having an outdoor unit outside your home at an indoor unit, and it gets connected to your furnace. So you don't remove your furnace. You keep your furnace there. Right? And this hit bump is going to replace your AC. So you don't need to have an AC when you get the hit bump in your home. Right. Okay. But it doesn't replace your furnace. You keep your furnace. It's a backup. Right. Yeah. I thought we, uh, incentive program is, um, where for replacing old units, uh, or units, uh, or anything that would be making your footprint. Yeah. The energy usage lower. I'm actually going to be increasing it, right? Not really. Like, as I said, when you have a hit bump, you'll be using your furnace only as a backup. So only when days, it's like beyond minus 25 Celsius outside. Only in very cool days, you'll be using your furnace as a backup. Other than that, all the time, it's the heat pump that's going to be running. So that's how you'll be saving on the gas bill. And they're not going to cost you, you know, increase in carbon footprint. That's what you're saying. Right. And, um, is that what the government program is going to cover? It's, there is like, uh, as I said, if you qualify, they have a criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a hit bump in your home. At zero percent interest rate. And you give this interest free money for a period of 10 years. 10 years? Yes. And you can qualify for up to 40,000. You don't need to use all of that, but that's why you can qualify up to. So this is the best product. 40,000. Yes. Interest free. That's crazy. Yeah, I know. Like, people who are looking into multiple upgrades in their home, you know, somebody like looking to get a walk. Get a water tank, when those don't heat and then cool and whatever, they can take advantage of the whole, like, you know, the whole money at your person interest for a period of 10 years. But if you guys are looking for the heat pump, you can just go for a heat pump itself. That's it. Like, just use that. I'll take a amount of money. What is also covered if I wanted to say I. I have a house that has a metal roof. And I have a very sunny spot. Is it covered like solar panels as well? Yeah, for solar panels, you can use this program for panels as well, solar panels. I just want to like go through the criteria with you first. You should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. Yeah. The house shouldn't be a new bill because new bill houses did not qualify. It should be at least six months older more. Okay. And it shouldn't be a condo or a pertinent. It has to be a house because the pertinent not qualify. And you should be a Canadian citizen or a peer holder with a fair credit score, no bankruptcy. That's it. Right. Yeah. Okay. Now Virginia, what I can do as I was saying, I can ask you for a talk with one of her advisor. She will provide you with the price and the product that we offer. And we'll just cut this program with you as well. Then if you like it, you can go ahead with it. Okay. Okay. How many of it about your home like when was your house built? There's two parts of the house. The new part is where I have a furnace. And that's where I live. And that's where I'm thinking of the heat pump. Then there's the old part of the house. Which is heated with a like a. A gas rat radiated kind of thing. So you turn it on and it heats up. The whole unit there. So other than that, it doesn't have. No doctor. Yeah. Yeah. It has a little water tank and it doesn't really have like. Yeah. Sure. Doesn't have air either. Oh, I see. Okay. And are these two parts of the house like side by side or on top of one another? Side by side. Side by side. There is one entry to the house or two entries. Like every part has a separate entrance. Yeah. Yeah. Are they like under one address or a different address? One address. One address. Okay. And what is this core footage of your part of the part that you live in? Okay. I don't know. But I did have somebody true. I was a little bit of a person. I was a little bit of a person. And they were quoting me for a two. Is it two times? 2000. Is it right to time? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. And the furnace that you have. Is that like a gas furnace? Yes. Okay. And how old is that one? So I say, um, not very old. This house here was built. It's a building that was built in 2016. Okay. Okay. Okay. And do you like owned both of the parts or are you the owner of both of them? Most parts of the house? Yeah. I own the whole thing. Yeah. Okay. And I'm moving here. I'm in the process of getting my house, my primary house that I live. Getting it ready to put on the market. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Okay. Okay. And let me check here. Is the other part of the house like on rent or what? On what? Are you like rent on the other half of the house? No. No. Okay. If you're a house like kind of like consider the duplex like two units. Nope. No one house with two parts. One house. Yeah. Two parts. Okay. And what's, yeah. The email address is going to confirm if the waypoint at Yahoo.com. Is that correct? Correct. And the home address, what I have here, it's only on Perial. Can I get the exact address please? Uh huh. 69. Main Street. Lame. I-N-D. M-A-I-N. Okay, Main Street of Marmaral, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Got it. Is it like a K0, okay, to M0? That's correct. Perfect. So, um, Virginia now for the online need-in, I have a availability for Monday, Monday at 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. What time do you prefer?

He's going to Friday pray. He's in the mosque and he not taking his phone with him when he goes to the mosque. Gotcha. We can definitely figure out a way of helping Mehmat as well. The only thing that I would say though is that tank less is not including the 0% loan. Okay. We can add it to the financial. The financial site. The financial site. But the heat pump would be added for the loan but not the tank less. So what about the Ontario government don't give that need tank less? 0%? Yeah, they don't. And how much the loan for a tank less? There is no loan on the tank less. We need to pay cash? We would do it like you guys don't have to pay cash. We can still give you a proof for that for the through our in-house financing. But it won't be at 0% through the government. It would be. There would be some type of 7.99 enters on the costs. Is that possible if we get the tank less and you just whoever come they just install it for us? There won't be responsible for that. I don't think that would do it. No. Okay. Okay. No problem. That's something I will talk with my brother as well. You when you started. Otherwise I will convince him to keep the same one what you have it. I'll try to whatever he said to me. But one thing Alex we need to do. The air condition is not the appropriate way where it's supposed to be. He wants to put heat pump on the other side. Not the same side where the air condition is.

20240524-142408_+14164094573_Incoming_Auto_2198270966042.mp3," This call is being recorded. Hello, Mr. Stupis. How good to have you? My name is Joe Valencia. I had an installation while back of just calling to find out the status of the rebate. Okay, sure. Let me just check that for you. Just give me a minute. Okay. I see that you did get the first energy audit done with the government auditor, Daniel. Correct. Yeah. Okay. So I see that the file has been submitted from our end and it's with Daniel right now. Did you get a chance with him recently about when it's with them or he he's not going to be able to do that. Daniel or he I thought he already submitted because I think he actually I think that as she sent an email to both you and I at one point saying that it was submitted. Okay, let me just look at that email. Right. And you had asked for the invoice as well. If I'm not wrong. I'm sorry. You had asked for an invoice which was to be sent to Daniel as well. That was a document. Yeah. Right. Yes, so everything's been submitted then. So how can I help you? How long does it take? Well, now that the file is so it's basically a thing is that the. Daniel has also submitted the file now to the government and we're basically waiting for them to process it and send the check directly to your mail. When it comes to timeline with this, I cannot give you an exact timeline because I'm not sure if you're aware, but there's a lot of backlog on the government center right now. So they're dealing with it and they don't give us any timelines as to when exactly are they present like we don't even know which months are they dealing with right now processing the files that they are right now. So I cannot. Yeah. Is there a way to check like online like to see the status or. I would recommend there's two specific ways. One is you can contact Daniel. He would know what is going on because he has access to the ported or you could also get in touch with Enbridge directly. If you give them your file number, which would be your energy audit report. Let me just double check. Okay. Okay. So the file number. What would I find the file number just checking and looking at the report now? I don't see a file number. Did Daniel share the pre and post audit reports with you? He says, Hi Joe attached is the audit reports. Right. So now the if you look at the name of that file. It's some alpha numeric number right one. Okay. So that's one X. Yeah, so the D is the report for your pre audit and the one that has an E in it. That's the post audit. Three files for the pre audit and then two files for the post audit for total five you have. If you would notice other than that alphabet D or E everything in that number is same. So if you give that number to Enbridge and you ask for an update on the status, they should be able to help you because if we ask. They deny giving us any information saying that only the homeowner can know that information. So I think it's that if you contact them directly. Yeah, and so. So how do I know that Daniel submitted it? I guess I just call him right to find out. Yeah, or you could just check with Daniel himself because he also has access because I'm not sure how does the like how well is the. Enbridge customer support functionally. So if you check with Daniel, he should be able to tell you everything about the status as well. Okay. Okay. So whatever you say. Yeah, you're most welcome. Yeah, just. Yeah, everything on our end has been done. The file has been submitted. So now it's just waiting for the government to process and send it to you. Okay. Thank you so much. You're most welcome. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye.",278.8619047619048,-0.0001312395324930549,0.9277204275131226,-0.9601548910140991,0.05350065976381302,182.3597732426304,0.2650269541778976,0.4900269541778976

You're self. I'm doing well. Thank you. I just got a message to give you a call. I'm sorry. I was on another call with another customer. I'll give you a little bit of a little bit of a call. Daniel, what's what's going on? You're saying you're having a hard time with your AC now? Yeah. Turning it on. I had trouble with the furnace, right? Okay. Yeah. And they had people come down two or three times and they said, but that last time they said, you're going to start building before because they come down and nothing's wrong. Okay, but is it your thermostat that you're having a trouble with? I don't I would. Is there a possibility of having it sent to my email how to operate it? Okay, so I can do better than that. So you don't have to play with your thermostat. I'm going to give you a number. The equal be thermostat. You have an equal be am I correct? Yes. Okay. I'm going to give you their number. You have to be in front of the thermostat when you call them. They will guide you step by step on how to set it, how to operate it, and how to put it to the temperature of your liking. But they won't give you a booklet. I know that you would just find online. There's no booklet that comes with it. It's all online. Let me just see if I can. Yeah. But if you give them a call, they will guide you. All right. And let me just just bounce something off here a bit. When I had trouble through the winter and then they would I think they came three times and just stared at the thermostat and they never even put the hand over the heater to see that it was just the air and the host being circulated. It was very, very frustrating for me. Okay. And now we're getting into air condition time. Right. So the heat pump was running. But I might have pushed some wrong buttons here because now the heat pump does nothing. Okay. So if you call equal be they're going to do the thermostat with you. If there is a problem with the therm with the equal be with the heat pump, there will be a code that is detected on your your equal be and they will give you the code and then we can send a tack. But if it's just your equal be that you're not sure how to operate, you have to give them a call first. Okay. And they might send me some information in right? Absolutely. Yeah. I'm just looking online right now to see if I can find something for you that I can send off to you. Give me a second. Okay. I found something. I'm going to send you what I found. And hopefully that helps as well. Okay. But I'm going to give you equal be phone number. Okay. You have a paper in a pen with you. Okay. I'll set. Okay. So it's one eight seven seven eight seven seven nine three two nine three two six two three three six two three three yes. And I have I'm going to repeat that one eight seven seven nine three two six two three three and for your email I got D. B. No. Okay. So D ranking. Okay. Ron on here. Let's fix this.

He had a heat pump installed in my house. I've had it insulated. I've had new windows put in. And his heat pump was set at 70. And I had mine set at 73 or something. And mine never stopped running. And his did because it got colder than 71 in his house. Okay. So there's something wrong. Whether it's the furnace or whether it's the heat pump or whether it's the. Okay. So give the eco be a call.

I think you are walking me through your experience in sales or whatever you're saying. If you may continue now. Yeah, absolutely. So just quickly, just to recap, started as a personal trainer, got comfortable selling face to face, figured out that sales is my passion, moving to the retail side of things, then COVID hit. So around 60% of our leads came warm from our website. And so it was really just about connecting with the customer. Understanding their needs, uncovering some things that they maybe didn't know about. And then being able to find a fit with our solution there. To be able to fit those needs. attendance and HR, so I was selling that directly to business owners or executive level customers. That's what I was doing there at ADP. I got really comfortable in cold calling, prospecting, using the full-scale cycle to pitch and sell. Of course, there was another side of it where we were presenting the service as well. I got really comfortable in using Zoom with my customers to be able to present to the service that we had. I was looking for something where I felt I'd be able to grow. That's when I moved on from ADP into the Glendale Group here, which is now a full business development position. I spent 90% of my time calling reaching out to businesses where we'd be a fit. The Glendale Group, what we do is we're a multi-trade service provider. I reach out to tenants of buildings and let them know that we want to be a service provider for them when it comes to dealing with handyman electrical plumbing and HVAC.

Yes, so I'm currently still working with the Glendale Group. For me right now, what I've seen over the past couple of months is that it's not quite the best culture fit for me. It seems that a lot of my colleagues here are a little bit old-school, a little bit older. I just don't see that. It's the best culture fit. I'm looking for something where I feel more comfortable in the office, and I feel like I've been reaching out. I feel like I've been experiencing the skills that I've built over the past five, six years. It really would make me a good fit for this position. That's why I've been to my resume. Okay, perfect. I think based from the overview of your experience, you are kind of suitable for the position that we're looking for. So I wanted you to come in the office for a face to face interview in Monday.

20240524-113201_2282_+19056917204_Outgoing_Auto_2198212485043.mp3," Good morning, Maryland speaking. Hey, Marlene, how are you doing? It's Alex from Weaver. We talked two days ago about the hip-hop particles. Thank you for sending all that information over. Do you receive the one that I sent you yesterday? Yeah, I did. Yeah, I was going through it. I left it on the kitchen table for my husband to go through it when he gets up this morning. That's amazing. So we didn't manage to get our air conditioning fixed. It was just a very small problem. So I think you were mentioning that there's another rebate coming up in beginning of June. Yes. So we do have a little bit of time. It's not as serious an issue as no air conditioning. So we're going to go a little bit slower and make sure we make the right decision on it and maybe wait to see what that rebate is. Yeah, the rebate would definitely be a good help because the good thing about the rebate is that you can combine it with the loan as well. Yeah, now that loan is not a situation where only certain number of people get it, right? Anybody can get it. Like it's not a quota sort of thing. It is based on a quota, but it's a little bit on how can I say this? It's a little bit on a first-come-first serve basis where there is a couple qualifications. It has to be your primary home. It has to be like you have to be the homeowner to prevent people from getting it for every cause like, especially nowadays in Canada, especially in Ontario. There's a lot of investors that own multiple properties. Yeah. Just for preventing people from using it, like let's say for five different properties, they're only making it for the primary home and owners. Okay, so have you heard of any people not getting the loan because of the quota basis? Like, I guess there are only so much money that's available through the government and then they end it? That loan actually came from the rebates before, right? With the rebate before, there was a lot of, like, because the rebates were so big, like 6,500 people were getting previously. A lot of people were not really like, since every single person was selling heat pumps, a lot of people were getting stuff promised that they did not get the liver in terms of they got an install pay for, but they never got the rebate. So what they did is that they moved that budget towards this loan and they made it a lot more strict in terms of like what actually equipment qualified for it, what, you know, like the criteria to qualify for it in terms of, you know, being the primary home. So as for now, we haven't heard anything that they will take it away. So for now, it's still going. And our biggest question that people ask us all the time is, I can they make the loan with the rebate? And so far, you can. Yes, it's something that you, the rebate is not going to be as much as before. I'm still waiting on the specifics just to be able to send it over to all my clients who are waiting for it. Okay. But the good thing is that the same energy outed that we work for the loan, it will be the same energy outed that it could qualify for the rebate as well. So we could go ahead and start with that. Exactly. If it's something that you choose to, it's something because the loan takes about two to three months to get approved and you don't get that money. But the rebate is instantaneously, right? Once you do the first outed, if you do pass on it and you get it installed, the rebate that will be able, I believe that might be able to fund you the funds on like ten days notice something like that. Okay, so the rebate is more, and how long does it take before you know that you qualify for the loan? It takes about an average six to eight weeks. Oh, it does, okay. Yeah. Okay, and can you apply for the loan before placing the order to see whether you qualify or not? For the loan, what they do need to see is that you for sure need to do the energy outed. Right. So for us, for example, if we would do it for you, it would have to be already after you send agreement. If you don't get the loan, you have to go ahead with the, with what you've ordered. We have a couple of options, the way that I do it for people who usually have like a smaller amount, which means just the heat pamphlet they. I usually get them approved for the 7.99% and if they don't get approved, they're still going to be saving money. Paying that amount so I leave it that way in your case. If there's no rush and it's not a hurry, what I would do is get you approved if you need the funds up front. We can get you approved from like a six month zero percent interest. And if it's fixed to a week, you don't get approved for the loan. What we could do is just avoid the whole thing and cancel the whole agreement. Okay, that's what I wanted to know. Perfect. Yeah, we do have the big sum of money in. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. Okay. All right, those are all good answers to the questions that I was thinking about. I'm going to, it looks like really good products that you've picked for us. So I get my husband to, he's also having major surgery on Monday, so that's why I want him to take a look at it now before he's not able to think. For at least a week. Okay, so that's a thousand percent because what we could do in that case is and we can leave this all alone that I will. Of course, add this all to the agreement for you guys is if you guys will be interested in the service, you know, the price. What we could do is get you for the first out of it. You would get it done after that first out of it, we will start the paperwork for the government and we would have an idea if you get approved for not. And the time he's already recovered, he's already doing better. That's when they can go over and actually install the whole service once we know you got approved. That's something that you guys could think about too. Perfect. Well, I think I'll hear that you're, yeah, go ahead. If you're any chance that you could just send me an email with those couple of points that so that I can add it to that we can get that interest free loan and wait for six months. I think you said what's that? It's six to eight weeks. Six to eight weeks. Okay. While the loan is being processed. Just because by the time I get home, I'm going to forget all of this. I can build it up in an email. It's in the juice. So you guys have it. I really, really appreciate that. No, not a problem. No, not a problem. Early. Okay. Thank you again. All right. Bye bye. Bye bye.",440.9338775510204,-0.0001099579603760503,0.7148853540420532,-0.7604922652244568,0.0646604374051094,184.562358276644,0.2187401883830455,0.4916684109541252

Oh, it might stick in to Linda. Yeah. Oh, hi Linda. I was just calling you a bit earlier today. I got an inquiry like your inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. Are you looking to get a heat bump installed in your home? Well, I was a pro, a film, an opal mess had called me. And I was approved for that. I was approved for AppLinesis.

And how much would that cost me for the heat pump? Oh, yeah, Linda, I myself work as an appointment booker. I cannot provide you with the exact price, but if I could give you a range, it would be anywhere from a 4,500 to 6,500. Because I can't pay that cash. Yeah, no, sure. There is like a government incentive program available. I'm not sure if you're aware of it or no. But if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at 0% interest rate. And you get this interest free money for a period of 10 years. And the example if I want to sell house again, so if you sell the house, this it will get transferred to the new owner. You don't get to suck with it. I mean, who pays the I have to continue my payment. Like whatever as I said, whatever is the price for the heat pump, you will get the money from government at 0% interest. And then you have a period of 10 years to pay it back. And it's all interest free. Yeah, okay. Yeah, what I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the exact price and discuss the product as well. Okay. All right. Can you just tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? It's a no house.

20240524-124826_2208_+14165657939_Outgoing_Auto_2198237795042.mp3," Hello. Hey, they're Frances. Yep. This is Kaya. I'm sorry I'm not spread around. Yeah, I was, I don't know if it was the Internet connection or if it was such a long delay, and I wasn't able to hear you. Yeah. Sorry, you were saying something, but I wasn't, I didn't hear anything you said. Oh, I think you're asking me what I thought of things. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So the price that you gave is somewhere, I don't know, maybe in the middle between some of the quotes that I've got. I get that your obviously a reputable company and all of that and there's certainly value there. In terms of warranty, if I were to compare it to some of the bigger ones there, they've got a better warranty because they, they use include longer labor warranty. In terms of incentive, I guess anybody can give me the greener home alone, that's just directly with the government. So while you can help me out with the paperwork, it's kind of independent of who actually does the work. Either way, I need to get the audit done. So, you know, I'm just going to put all the quotes together, connect together. That's the products that you're getting quoted for are also on the list. Oh, exactly right. That was the biggest thing that happened with the rebate. That was what I was saying with the scams and the fraudulent things that were happening with the rebate, which is why the government completely put it to a stop, is because homeowners were, you know, unfortunately getting fooled by contractors and companies saying, hey, this heat pump is going to qualify, you were going to help you with everything. They, you know, they installed it, they paid for it upfront or financed it for 15 years or whatever. And then they're now finding out months and months later that it didn't even qualify at all for a rebate. So that's, you know, that's a production of a product to show which ones qualify. You can go on the government website, I believe, and they should have, it should be a way to locate what's on the list. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then also the auditors too, because the auditors, you know, there's a list of, you know, certified or licensed auditors that also have to be on that list, if either embridge or through Canada Greeners directly. So they can show you the list on the website as well. But again, this is why, you know, this is why on our end, I mean, our pricing is super competitive based on what we're offering. We can look at, you know, let's say, for example, the blade excite you were quoted significantly less. I can look at that system and probably give you a much less quote as well. But it kind of defeats the purpose of the, of the loan, first of all. And then also of just the overall efficiency in the home, right? Why are you looking to make sorry, go ahead? Well, I mean, I don't really, I don't like playing this game, but I mean, you're saying that you have a thing where your, your lever will be in any quote by like, you know, 10% or something like that. So as long as it's comparing apples to apples, yeah. As long as it's comparing apples to apples. So if I were to get a quote just before I pull the trigger on it, if I send it to you, you go, you know what? For this same equipment, we either can beat it, match it or are unable to do that. You know, that's something that you guys would do. Absolutely. Absolutely. It is a policy that we have as long as it compares apples to apples. You know, I've done it several times for my clients. I obviously have to send it over to management for approval. But once we look at it, if it's the same product and you know, pretty much within the same, you know, services and products that we're offering, we will beat it by 10%. Okay. That sounds good. You know when you were looking to pull the trigger on your notes? Yeah, when I do it, I want to do it as soon as possible because the furnace is broken. Yeah, for sure. If we told something that AC doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is impossible, but I'm not, you know, I'm not rushing the process because, you know, I want to make sure I get the right stuff in without causing an nominal. But yeah, pretty much as soon as possible. Okay. The only reason I, I mean, you can get a heat pump been sold at any time and we can do that for you anytime. So, what I would say is maybe slightly more time sensitive is the incentive program because the government is unpredictable and, you know, as far as the incentive go. And they have advised us that they're only extending it for a window time. There is no date, of course, but that's what they've mentioned to us. So anyway, here's what I'm going to do for instance, I will send you an email with the, you know, what's the breakdown of the package, the cost and all that. Do you know when you'd be able to send me over a quote like that quote or? Well, I haven't, I haven't decided. I got to like, you know, get all these quotes. I got to kind of put them all together and see which ones are like. Sure. Which I like the best, but it'll be soon. I mean, it's Friday now. So maybe I'll do some work on the weekend on the weekend. Okay. Yeah, so it might be like more like Monday or something when all. Yeah, for sure. Have an idea. For sure. So what you can do, we're Friday today, I will send you an email soon as we get off the school with the breakdown of everything. And then if you want to, if you have some time and over the weekend, you want to send me a quote that kind of compares apples apples. When I get in on Monday, all forwarded over to management and I can give you a show and then we can go from there. Is that fair? That sounds great. Okay, awesome. What time is usually best to give you a show during the day? Maybe like 9.30, 10 o'clock in the morning. Earlier if I could do Monday, I could do 11. Is that okay with you? Sure. Okay. Okay. Sounds good, Frances. I will go ahead and send you that email shortly. If you do have any questions on my contact details or touch the email so you can always shoot me an email. Or this is my direct line, you can give me a call. Do you have any other questions for me before we part ways? Not right now, but it wouldn't surprise me if I do have some later and I'll just reach out here. Yeah, reach out. You can always email or shoot me a text on this line, doesn't matter. And then I'll wait for that quote and we'll touch base on Monday morning. All right. Thanks very much, Mariam. You have a good weekend. You too. Thank you, Frances. Take care.

I thought you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad. Are you? So from which company? It's Weaver, E.Ca home. E.Ca home. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I just written inquiry about the earth and. Oh, heat bump. Oh, a heat bump. It does cool and and heat and it works both like an ACS leather heater. It can use it in both seasons. Yeah. Okay. So now basically the main why I call so my ACS is not working right so I'm I heard from my contractor that I need to replace my AC. It's the old one. Obviously I have a furnace and AC separate. Yeah. So that's the condition I'm right now. So I have to replace my AC and my structure is working. Okay. I'm willing to know what what you can offer. Sure. So, uh, push a heat bump. It has an outdoor unit that's going to be outside of your home. Just the same way the ACS outdoor unit is, right? And that it has an indoor unit that's that's a coil and it gets connected to the furnace. And through the dock work, it's going to provide you with heat and and coolant. Okay. You'll be you don't need to like remove your furnace or anything. You keep your furnace at the back up because as far as the heat and part of a heat bump is concerned, it works perfectly fine till minus 25 Celsius outside. Only when it goes beyond that the heat bump shuts down and the furnace kicks in. So when you get a heat bump in addition to using it for coolant in summer, you can use it in winter as well and save almost 75% on your gas bill because you want to use a near furnace. You'll be using your furnace only as a backup. Okay. Okay. Does someone say anything? Yeah. Yeah. Do you, uh, do you have any idea about the government incentive programs or no? I mean, yeah. One point, the one of the reliance that was and he was explaining me six months back. But I wanted to also kind of hear it from you, right? I don't know what you're after that. Yeah. There used to be a rebate program which ended on January this year. However, for homeowners who miss out on the rebate, government had expanded a limited time interest-free funding program. So as per this one, whatever is the cost of the heat bump, government will give you that money to get a heat bump in your home at new person interest. And you give this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. Did you know about this? Or no? I don't know. What was earlier than when they were giving us grants to change? Yeah, the grant. Yeah, the grant was through Canada Greener Homes, the federal program. It was for people who would change the heat and then cool into the heat bump. It was a grant. But it ended on January. It was for end-bridge users, it was 6,500. For a non-enbridge, it was 5,000. 5,000. And what would be the total cost of insulation? Oh, I myself work as an appointment with her. What I can do is I can connect you with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the fact price and the product that we offer. But as I told you, push, there is no more rebate available. It's only the interest-free program at the moment. Okay? Yeah, that is fair, but you know, what can we do right? I didn't act on that. That's why. It's okay, but I think you said reliance, right? So do you have any of your stuff through reliance, like your furnace or AC or no? Yeah, what a heaters. It is entered. Water heater. Okay, okay. All right. You wanted to make sure. Okay. So tell me a bit about your home lake when was your house built? I told one. I think it's 1960 or 70. And it's a bungalow or two story? Bungalow. What's the house size in its square feet like roughly? Roughly 1600. And how old is your furnace? I really don't know. And do you think it's more than 15 years or less than 15 years? Less than 15 years. Okay. And this is your primary residence and you worry the homeowner is cracked? Yeah. Okay. What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. Yeah. So just the electricity bill, right? And what about gas, the end brush bill? Okay. Now the email address what I have here just to confirm. It's peroshoth.gen at jimil.com is that correct? Or it's can you confirm? Yeah, you can. What a trade here. Okay. And the home address what I have here is only on Torio. Can I give you exact address please? It's 2 to 3 0. Fraser Avenue. Fraser? Yeah, if R.A. is the Fraser. Yeah, Windsor? Windsor? Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So all right. So now for the online meeting, I have availability for tomorrow. Tomorrow we can look into a 2 15 p.m. or 4 15 p.m. What time do you prefer? 4 15 please. Sure. Above the one for tomorrow at 4 15 p.m. tomorrow morning you'll get the Google Meet link in your email address so you can join us using your phone or computer. It's up to you at 4 15 p.m. Sounds good? Okay. Okay. Sounds good. All right. Thank you. Bye bye now. Thanks.",404.28589569161,-0.0001301007869187742,1.328486204147339,-1.337536811828613,0.1101435422897339,224.911746031746,0.2693785837700312,0.4978851010101009
20240523-173721_2208_+15193309606_Outgoing_Auto_2198122070043.mp3," You're late, Colin. What's going on? Hi there. Yes, sorry, Lauren. I ran really late on my last appointment. My apologies. Are you still available now or? Yes, I am. I'm just sitting down, relaxing, trying to take it easy and whatever. Okay, okay, good, good. Relaxing is good. So thank you so much for joining me this after or this evening. Quick introduction to myself. So my name is Mariam. I have had the pleasure being with the company for about three years now. I've learned a lot about becoming more eco-friendly and more importantly helping homeowners become a lot more efficient with their homes. So that is a little bit about me. Lauren, tell me a bit about yourself. What's the name, goal, or motive for getting a heat pump installed in the home? Save money. Yeah, efficiency. Yeah. And the other problem is I need to probably purchase a brand new air conditioner. Okay. That cost is, you know, I don't know, $45,000 or whatever for a new air conditioner. So, you know, for a little extra money for a heat pump. And it takes advantage of the, you know, being able to cool the house with the heat pump and heat the house when it's like like the last couple of winners. Like you don't need to firm this anymore because it's all like the prime prime zone for the heat pump. So, you know what's, you know what's going to happen, right? What's up? The price of hydro is going to go up exponentially. And all the savings and all the green shit and everything that everybody was thinking that they were going to do. It's going to cost them in the long run. Like it seems like, and you know why? Because I'm 65 years old, okay. And I've run into this situation so many times in my life. And it's like, oh, I'm going to save a buck. I'm going to save some money here. And I'm going to purchase whatever. And then after I purchase and get involved in the whole thing, the price of the original, you know, let's say you're till watch per hour. All of a sudden double. And there goes the there goes the advantage of having, you know, difference between natural gas and just a regular air conditioner. So, I know that's coming and everybody else does. And I'm sure, you know, if you don't know, it's, it's because of the green. And I would say the green revolution. And it's going to put a very large. Demand on the grid system. And when that happens. The prices of everything, trans, you know, delivery, transportation, production of the hydro. So I'll go up. Degree or disagree? Yeah. Well, I don't want to I don't want to put it in the you know, I mean, you have a lot more experience than I do. So, but I guess the well, a couple of things. I mean with that, you're on gas, right, Lauren? Yeah. Wrong. Yeah. I'm on gas. And I don't like 85% efficient gas furnace. Yeah. 20 years old, right? Right. So I'm kind of thinking, well, I don't know, do I spend 10 grand, you know, upgrade the gas system? Or do I spend whatever to upgrade to heat pump? I would say the heat pump is probably the, I would say that's better because even let's say, you know, now you're eliminating, I mean, got your gas is not going to be eliminated 100%. But it is going to, it is going to cut down in the winter time because these high efficiency cold climate systems, the newer heat pumps. They will heat up your home efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. So your gas. Celsius or. Yes. So, yeah. Yeah. So that's amazing. You know, because they're so efficient to that temperature. So, you know, the, the, hopefully we don't get too many. I mean, it's the far end in between. We're going to get too many of those days. So it's not down, not down, not down here in southern Ontario. Yeah, you're in. I don't. I actually have a lot of family in. So I'm, I'm aware of, I'm familiar with the area. And, and this guy, guys, fish in here. All year round last year. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There was nothing. It's just dirt clouds and miles. Yeah, my dad was fishing too. So, um, yeah. Up here. Who? He's just outside of Sarnia. So I have some cousins and, uh, aunt and uncle in Sarnia. And then, are you know where Wallaceburg is? Oh, yeah. Wally will. Well, exactly. Yeah. So he's, he's in there. Yeah. That's where he is. But we go into Sarnia law, especially in the summertime. Um, but yeah. So, yeah. You guys are, I mean, down there, it's, it's very uncommon to, to get temperatures like that. So the gas furnace is really only being used as an emergency backup. Yep. And that's exactly what I'm, I'm planning on just leaving it as is in the, in the basement, not replacing nothing on that. And, and just going to a heat pump. And, uh, that way I can get air conditioning and, and take advantage of the, uh, the weather to heat the house as well. So my question is, um, with the air conditioning that I already have, yeah, would the heat pump be able to hook up to that? Or do you have to replace all the lines and, and all the, uh, exchanges and stuff? No, as long as the lines are in good condition, like they're not, uh, torn up or ruined or anything like that. And we don't, you don't have to take out the exchange or the lines, but the, the actual, obviously, the AC unit has to be replaced with the outdoor unit of the heat pump. Yep. Um, but no, the lines, um, as long as they're, like, they're running efficiently in the home, um, those don't have to be replaced. Yeah. Okay. Right? Yeah. So what would you look at? Uh, this is connecting the lines up the air conditioner and then having it hooked up to the heat pump. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. So there's two parts of the heat pump. I'm sure it sounds like, you know, you're, you're a pretty good idea with the, how the heat pump works and the efficiency. So the two parts is going to be the outdoor unit and then the internal part that connects to the outdoor unit is the Unix case coil similar to an AC, but of course it's the heat pump. Yeah. And we'll be installing that in or on your existing furnace. They do kind of run in conjunction with each other or communicate with each other, but they are still two completely separate systems. Yeah. Okay. So just to clarify, Lauren, we do use like the, you know, the cold climate, the newest, uh, efficiency heat pumps. So they will go efficiently in the wintertime, uh, anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. Yeah. Temperature that will get colder than that. Um, you know, your gas furnace kicks in automatically as an emergency backup. Right. And that's exactly what I'm, I'm, I'm looking for. Yeah. And there's, to be honest with you, natural gas is pretty cheap. Yeah. And I, I, you know, I can't complain on that for the heat and the house and stuff. But if I have to replace my air conditioner, my air conditioner is going to cost me three, four thousand dollars. Yeah. If you want to high efficiency with warranty installed usually, I mean, depending on the size of the home and the unit, but it's usually between 35 to 5000 easily. Yeah. And the good thing with these newer heat pumps, um, uh, Lauren, is there actually a lot more efficient than even newer AC systems on their own. A couple of reasons for that. A because they've recently advanced the technology with heat pumps with the free on. So that's why these newer systems are so efficient. But more importantly, uh, uh, average AC systems are, you know, AC systems in general average anywhere from 10 to 12 here or 13 here. These heat pumps, depending on again, what size and brand, but they range anywhere from 18 to 25 here. Yeah. So I mean, homeowners are not just noticing what these heat pumps are not just noticing a reduction or savings in the winter time with the fuel cost. They're also noticing their hydro bills go down in the summertime as well. Yeah. And that's what I'm looking for really because, uh, well, right now there's a ton, a ton and a half air conditioner on the side of my house that like entire need of replacement. Yeah. So I contacted a contractor who took advantage of the, uh, the energy program back in December. Yeah. Last fall. Yeah. And he had a two ton unit available for like 2000 bucks plus installation. And then he gave me the quote, he gave me the quote for about $3,500 to $4,000. Right. Oh, okay. That's fine. You know, I don't mind whatever. So then I'm kind of thinking, well, it's going to cost me for a new air conditioning unit. That's going to cost me even more for the hydro to run it, right? Because it's 220. And, uh, I'm kind of thinking, well, maybe I should just check in the air conditioning unit and just go to the heat pump and forget about all this crap. And then I think that's going to be the thing that I'm going to tell you about when it comes to the water, because now, not only are you going to get more efficient cooling and save on your hydro in the summer, but you're going to basically, um, you're going to cut out your gas, build by about 70 80% because the gas is only uses a backup, right? So, well, we just moved into to the city, which is a whole different environment, but when I was in the country, and I had a like a $2,500 square foot house that was, I took advantage of all the energy, you know, programs. I used spray foam the outside top and bottom and then re re covered it in the whole nine yards and barely and then had M uh, and I killed a feeling full of, you know, whatever installation and seal everything off. And even in the cold month of January, when I was in the country, where there is no wind bill, here's whatsoever. Yeah, yeah, it's all open. 65 to 70 bucks a month, okay? Oh, wow. Yeah, that's really low. Yeah, 25 on its square foot house. So, I move into this place, which is around 12 to 14 hundred square feet, and it cost me about the same. Yeah, yeah. The city is always the pricing is always different. So, what's the size of your EC like in tons, you know, 1.5? Okay, yeah, that's what I figured. So, with the heat pump, you probably know it's also calculated in tons, but Lauren, because now it's not just we're not just looking at the cooling aspect. We're also looking at the heating aspect as well. You always want to size up slightly with a heat pump. So, for your home, I would go, I think the two ton would be more than enough for your eyes. So, I agree. And then, um, do you have a smart thermostat? Yeah, I got one that's hooked up there, everything that a schedule temperature up and down and cool up and down and all that stuff, right? Do you know how long ago did you get it installed? Is it recent or? Yeah, well, I couldn't figure out the one that they had here back in November. It was completely nan or solid. Oh, gosh. I just tore it out through it down and got this one that was only like, I got, you know, I bought it, whatever. So, I can program the temp up and down at night and weekdays, weekdays and all that stuff, right? Okay. You know if it's a eco beer, is it a nest? What? Is it the nest smart thermostat or the eco beer? Or you're not sure? Well, I don't know what's the difference between a smart one and whatever. Oh, it's just a brand. So, you can, it's, it's, uh, it connects to Wi-Fi, right? And you can, and you can control the temperature? No, no, mine's not that high-tech. Okay. If it's brand new, you just cut it in. And it's a program of one, not a problem. It should be compatible with the heat pump if you don't fancy a smart thermostat. Otherwise, the usually we would include it. You know what? The thermostat is at least in my words. Like I mean, the heat pump shows up and if thermostat coincides with the heat pump, perfect. Okay. So we'll do that. You know, like if it's going to cost me an extra $1,500 or whatever for thermostat and then have it set up. So then, you know, when the heat pump sort of rains of efficiency, the gas kicks in or gas kicks in to help, right? Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah. So we'll include that. And then we have our warranty. So it's the good thing with the warranty that is done separately or directly through us is not just like your basic manufacturing. For the standard, it's 10 years all parts, one year labor and you do have 24 seven service access to it at all times. Yeah. And then, of course, the, of course, the hot water to. No, the hot water. Yeah, no, unfortunately, that would be kind of like a boiler system. Yeah. No, I'm kidding. Yeah. That's the next step for heat pump. Well, there is, it did. Sorry, are you talking about the heat pump water heater? Or. No, have you heard of that? Yeah. Well, I'm getting one put in. Oh, okay. Oh, awesome. Yeah, they do have heat pump, uh, heaters for the pool. And then they also have a heat pump, uh, water heater as well. So, if you replace your, your tank. So, it runs off, it uses like super minimal, um, energy. They say like a large tank uses like less than a 40 watt light bulb. So, it's super efficient. Okay, so if you wanted to look at, I'm, I'm assuming you kind of want to get an idea on a, on a coat, right? Or like the car. Yeah. So, if we're looking at the. Even with the hot water. And have it separate, separated out from the heat pump. Like I mean, do you understand what I'm saying? Uh, the water heater, you mean? Yeah. Or the. No. Yeah, I can give you the heat pump, the heat pump is one quote. And then if you can, if you can. Get energy from the heat pump. The. Produce hot water. Yeah. You can't. No, you can't. You can't, unfortunately, because they're air source straight. So, it would be two separate things. Okay. So, for your home, like, so this would be like the quote that I would be giving you, uh, Lauren, would include like the full hybrid heat pump system, the two tons. And of course, it's the cold climate, you know, highest efficiency. Uh, so you get the outdoor unit, the indoor unit, the smart thermostat warranty and full installation. All land you'd be looking at 6200 plus H. Just. Okay. So that doesn't sound too bad. Yeah. It's pretty. It's a little bit higher than an ace, getting a high efficiency AC with a warranty. But now, I mean, you're going to get your return back in less than a year, uh, because the, the heat pump obviously is not just the cooling part of the heat. It's the heating part too, right? Right. And these systems are super high efficiency. I mean, they will have maintained well. They last, um, approximately 15 years plus. Yeah. Okay. So I'm 65. So by the time I'm 80 or 85, I don't know why. So if I don't, I won't need to worry about it too much. You won't need to worry about it. Yeah, exactly. So that's, that's what I'm looking at. Right? Yeah. Looking at four or $5,000 for freakin' air conditioner. Exactly. It's. It's $45,000, $4,500, $35,000, and you haven't really hit the sales point yet. Have you? What's that? Oh, yeah, so I thought that was going to be my next question. So of course, you're aware that they are no longer offering rebates, but they did extend the Southern Census Program, which is the, so I guess you do know about it, is the government funding for 10 years. And if you're approved, it's 0%. So is that something that you're also interested in as well? Okay, so good. So, um, good, good. Tell me what you want to give me. Somebody want to give me some money for nothing. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. I'll pay it back. I'll pay it back very, very nicely over the next 10 years. Yeah, and they give you a period of 10 years. So it's completely open-learned. It's not, it's unsecured. The only thing, so there's a couple of requirements. As far as the eligibility goes, it is pretty straightforward. I mean, the approval is about 98%. Okay? Yeah. As long as you're a Canadian citizen, as long as you're on the home, it's your primary resident. You don't have anything major on your credit to like a bankruptcy proposal, a fairly good credit standing. I got a really good credit. Awesome. Good. Now, the government is only accepting limited applications right now because they have advised us that they are ending this program shortly as well. But the good thing on our end, Lauren, is we work very closely with the auditors in the government process. So we are able to secure in the applications for our clients to cross Ontario. Oh, you're good. Yeah, one of the requirements, I'm not sure if you know this. Do you know what an energy audit is? Oh, yeah. I had one done when I regid my house in 2016. Okay. And I got about $5,000 or $6,000 back. Oh, awesome. Okay. I had to get an independent auditor to come in and I paid him, I don't know, two, three hundred bucks to do it in order, you know, like that part. Yeah. And that's the part I just, I don't understand. I know. I know. And I guess it's part of their very verification process of what's happening. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, the government, anytime it moves in, send a program, so you've taken advantage of rebates or incentives in the past. Anytime they have an incentive program, an energy audit is required. It's just how, it's just the paperwork that gets submitted and how they qualify you, so to speak, on the home. There's two audits that's done, as you probably know, a pre-audit and a post audit. Total cost is 700 to cover both. The government will fund that back to you though, like on approval when, you know, you get approved for the interest rate loan. They do also fund back the audits as well. But it is a requirement. Yeah. So, the good thing on our end, like I said, we do work with most of the major auditing companies across Ontario, that something we would be able to coordinate in a sentry schedule for you as soon as possible. Sure. Sounds good. That would be the only difference with going with the incentive program versus not, as you do need to get the audits done. But, so yeah, I guess that's, I know you kind of wanted the bottom line and you had a really good understanding of the heat pump system. Yeah. Your AC is not working, like it did it stop working completely as of now? No, it's still working. Okay. It's just old. Yeah. And it's old and it needs to be replaced. That's all. Right. I see. So, what is your, like, you know, especially if you want to take advantage of the incentive program, what is your timeline to get this done essentially? A-S-A-P. Yeah. Okay. You know, like I mean, the hot weather is coming here. Yeah, it is. The last plan I was just dealing with, they're AC completely broke down. The last couple of days. So, I get it. It's super hot. So, you know what? I worked my whole life shift work for 25 years before I had air conditioning. Right. So, I know what's all about. Yeah, yeah. So, go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, no, I was just going to say, Lauren, one of the other requirements I forgot to mention to you with this incentive program. Similar to the rebate program, you know, before as well. The government needs to not only see that you've gotten your audit done, but, you know, obviously, that you've applied. You've gotten the installation completed and the work paid for because that's the invoice that you have to submit. You know, they need to see that it's been installed and paid for in order for them to refund you the full amount or fund you the amount. So, I just wanted to mention that that is the requirement as well. Yeah. Good point. So, yeah, I just, okay, okay, perfect. So, I guess based on everything that I've gone over with you as far as the, you know, the package, the pricing, the incentive program, I think the biggest thing, I mean, incentive programs are great in all, but I think the biggest thing is the efficiency and how, you know, what the return is going to be for you going with a heap of verses AC, right? Of course, the incentive program and then our entire process, what are your thoughts? Oh, I mean, I'm game for, you know, it's going to cost me $23,000. Extra for a heap up over air conditioning unit and end up in, you know, gain on cooling and heaving. You can't lose. Yeah, exactly, exactly. I would agree. That's my thought. So, what we can, what we can do, I can walk through basically the next step because you, I mean, you can get a heap pumped out at any time, you know, that's obviously always there. So, I would say with a little bit more of a sense of urgency or time-sensitive is this incentive program as they've advised us, I mean, just like the rebates, they kept us in the loop as well. So, if I look, I know you're in Sarnia, the first thing would be to secure an attentive date with a licensed auditor for the audit. How, how do you prefer weekdays weekends or it doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. It's all good. So, I'm just going to quickly walk you through the steps as far as, you know, how the process works. So, step number one is I would have to send you a virtual agreement. And if you're going to do two things for you, Lauren, number one, we're going to stick here in the application for you for the interest for loan. Number two, we're going to stick here in that tentative date with the licensed auditor because it is the first come first served with them. Hi. I've been doing so, so in securing those and starting the process, there is a $500 security deposit required. It's not an additional amount. It is included in the $6200 I quoted you. It's just a simply deposit. And then what will happen is the auditor will come. They'll come see it be, you know how the process works. And then we can coordinate once the auditor is completed that, we can coordinate the install you know, pretty shortly after. But our team will also walk you through step by step on the application process and how to submit all the documents that are required. And then what happens once you get it installed at page four and then you said you're okay with that front that does matter, then we will get the post audit completed. So, the same letter comes back confirms everything. Once that's good to go, then you know, after that process and application, we will submit everything to the government from there. Yep, sounds good. So I do need to send you the, you know, you're in starting, do you prefer weekdays, week and third doesn't matter? Doesn't matter. I'm retired. Okay, so if I look at, sorry, Mia, so I can, what I can do, Lorna, I can book a tentative date for you. We'll have to walk through the virtual agreement. I'm going to email it over. And then what will happen is everything forwards over to our dispatch team. They're great. They're going to be in touch with you, but they have more access to the auditor's schedule in your area so that it will be able to confirm at 100%. But for now, I can tentatively book you for like mid or end next week. Sounds good. So let's say, let's say when say the 29th for now, again, that's not seven stone. The dispatch will have to confirm it. But so Wednesday's the 29th. And then Lorna, I know like as far as the, you know, the payment goes other than the deposit, obviously the full payment afterwards is not required until the installation is fully completed, of course. But would you be doing it via credit card or certified? Yes. Credit card. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. Let me just confirm that I have the correct spelling of your full name on file. Sure. So I have first name Lorna L-O-R-N-E and last name, font F-O-N-P. Yep. You got it. Okay. Perfect. If you just bear with me about two to three minutes, I'm just going to put it, I'm going to mute you, but I'm still on the line here. I'm just going to put the agreement together. I'm just going to give me about two to three minutes. Okay. Here. Oh, sorry, very quickly, Lorna. I forgot to also mention this. We're going to include the audit fee on this agreement as well, because when we submitted to the government, they like to see everything on one invoice. Okay. Yes, that's right. So I just want to take them from that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. All right. Give me a moment here. Go. I'll give you a last minute. Two. Two. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. One. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. Two. One. Really dispose of this. Come here, man. Can you go over there? Can you go over there? Can you move over here? Can you move over there? Could it be a better place to go towards this place? You can move it closer to the diving board. Place when a little bit further away. And then I'm wondering if I'm going to get steps from here down, you know, for getting the input potion So, that's it. Diving in, people can dive off the diving board, jump in, and then climb out there, just floating around when I get out, taking it out over there. And, step. So, now I'm in the midst of figuring out, replacing our air conditioner with a heat pump. So, for $2,000 difference, get rid of the air conditioner, put in the heat pump, and then it will keep the house cool in the summer, and it will keep it warm through the fall. Well, I'm talking to somebody. I'm not going to live it. Well, I wasn't expecting you to say you wanted to do that, but I put it in your free spot. So, that's what I'm going to put along, side of the garage for drainage. It's going to be done right. It's going to be good. And people. Look at this. I mean, when this is done, it's going to be primal. And the primal part isn't going to cost me $50 grand to have it happen. All those, you see this, all this right here, Vic. It's going to go right up to the house. All this brick work. It's going to go up there, up the other side, right to the house. So, and then the diving board. Like a mean. And then, the garden. Okay. Here we go. You know, like, okay, hi there, Lauren. Hi. Hey there. Okay. Thank you for waiting. I am just about to email it over to you now. Just let me know once you receive it there on your end. Okay. Well, I'll check it here right now. Okay. Let me just see. Yeah, it's just sending over to you right now. Yeah, I don't see it yet. Okay. Sometimes it takes a minute or so to come through. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's good. We're over that. Anyway. Here, I'll check it again. Let me make sure we have the right email. Yeah, it's your email, right? Did it just get old? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, it's pretty easy if you just open that email. You should see where it starts signing and then proceed to document to open it up. Okay. That was good. Okay. My back's hurting me. Sure. Yeah. No, no, no, no. It's okay. I feel you. So, why don't we look at it here? Did you were you able to open it up on the first page? Yeah. Okay. 72 hundred bucks. Minus five. No, no, six. Sorry, that's 62. 62 hundred for the full heat pump system that I quoted you. And then I included the energy audit, which includes both audits. You're pre and your post because they like to have everything on one invoice. So, I'm looking at a total of six nine hundred bucks. Grant total of seven, seven, ninety seven. Right? Yeah. So, that includes the audit after tax. Okay. Okay. So, I'm looking at total of six nine hundred bucks. Grant total of seven, seventy seven, ninety seven. Right? Yeah. So, that includes the audit after tax. Okay. And I get that audit money back. Yes. They will fund you the full, so the 100 for the full system, heat pump system, and then the full audit, the 700 as well. Okay. So, everything that's on this one invoice, you'll get funded back. Okay. Okay. Except the price of the heat pump. Right? No. Sorry. What can you repeat that? I said, you just told me it was going to get everything back from this invoice. Right? Yeah. And the total is $6,900. Correct? Yeah. Including the audit. Yep. Including the audit. Yep. Okay. So, I'm going to get that back. You're going to get exactly. They will fund you back. The 69 will after tax. They they fund you back. Right? So, including the audit and the full heat pump system. So, then what's my cost to purchase the heat pump system from my house? The $6,200 that I quoted you. So, $6,200 is the full cost of the full heat pump system with the SmartBermis.Warranty and full installation. Oh. Okay. All right. And then I included the audit. And then if you can see the breakdown after the deposit, which I'm going to send you a security link after we do this, because we don't want your credit card information on the invoice. I'm going to send you a security link to put it in. That would be the total balance that would be required the 7297 after your deposit after the installation is completed. Okay. All right. So, the agreement or the is pretty straightforward. I don't know if you can see on the first page. The bottom left hand corner. Do you see two boxes there? I see the little highlighted green signature. Yeah. So, one is the signature. And then the one below is just to type in your name, which should actually pop up when you click on it. Yeah. Okay. And so, my next question is. Yeah. So, just interest free loan for 10 years. What is the cost for me per month to pay off? Hey, per month. So, it would work out to let me just add it up right now. So, if we broke it down monthly, because they give you a period of 10 years. So, it's open. But if we broke it down, let me just calculate here. So, including the audit, just under 65. I'm just going to run up $65 per month, that's zero percent. Sounds good to me. Yeah. And then plus the extra cost for hydra to be. Yeah. So, the hydro on average across the board. And this was done all across Ontario. Is anywhere between 50 to $65 a month a year round. That's usually the average. Depending on the size of the home and how many people living in the usage, right? Yep. Yep. Well, there's two of us and probably half the time we're not going to be here. But anyway. Yeah. So, it's probably, you'll probably be on the lower average. So, the total for, let's say 12 times 50 is, what is that? 12 times 50, 600. 600 plus the loan, which is zero percent, correct? Zero percent. It's completely interest free and open for 10 years. Okay. And what's the loan payment? $65 a month. So, for 110 a month for 10 years, right? Yep. Yep. I'm good for the only thing I have to pay for is hydro. Yeah, but it's just hydro. Now you're pretty much eliminated. I mean, in the winter time, you're eliminating your gas by like 80, 90%. Right? Yes. It's just there is an emergency backup. So, that's the biggest advantage and why it makes the most sense to do the, you know, heat pump versus the AC. Because the AC system is not that much cheaper and there's no incentive on it. And it doesn't cover your gas or your heating, right? Right. And exactly. That's what I'm looking at. So, you guys will probably get your return back. Usually we're seeing, especially with the interest free loan. People are getting the return back within less than a year on the heat pump system. That's hard to believe. Yeah. But whatever. Yeah, I mean, it depends on the home of course and the averages and five. That's usually, I mean, two years is usually the max. Yeah. But your bills are pretty in your home, you know, considering the size, it's only the two of you. It will probably be quicker for you guys to get the return or payback. Yeah. Okay. All right. So. I'll, uh, scribble some crap on the. Read stuff when I get back to my computer and. If you, if you have it pulled up, you can do it right from your phone. Yeah. I usually like to walk my clients through it. So if you, if you want to, um, you still have it open or did you close it? Yeah. I'm still here. So it's pretty easy. You just, if you just click on the box, you don't even have to, you don't have to write in. Okay. Done. And then when you do both boxes, you're going to see a green finish button. You can click on. And then I'll just confirm that I received it on my end. So. I signed it. I print my name right now. Yeah. And I'm on page two of two. And. Do you see a green finish button at all? Anywhere on the page? Nope. I don't. Are you zoomed in to it? Yeah. Pretty well. If you zoom out again. So. Okay. Set up charge. Basically, two, twenty two hundred installation charge. Administration. Oh, geez. Oh, no, that's. That's it. So that's that's cancellation fee. So what happens? And, you know, we don't get this very rare. You know, it's very rare. But if we've already done the audit and we've already started the install. Yeah. And. And someone wants to cancel like after it's been installed. And there's. Or in the middle of the installation. There we go. I've got a finished button here now. Yeah. Click on click on finish. And then let me know. What it tells you? It's his email to me. You can email a copy or download. You are going to get a copy, e-mail, to rate away as well. So you'll get that shortly. from there as well. Okay. All right. I hit the email, it should be. So, anyway. Perfect. So, you'll get a copy. And then I'm just waiting to receive it. And then there's also the security deposit I'll have to do with you as well, Lauren. Yeah. Yeah. I just r",3058.421904761905,-8.84709443198517e-05,0.9964542984962463,-1.027497053146362,0.06581968814134598,1532.940544217687,0.210033088920649,0.5131473661019114
20240523-182720_+13433631219_Incoming_Auto_2198132644043.mp3," This call is being recorded. Home, I speak into George. Yes. Hi, George. This is Hussnell, which is Colleeny with earlier today. And regards to your online inquiry about a heat pump. Yeah, I was looking for you there, a heat pump or an air conditioning unit from my home. But I live a nowhere near Vaughan and North of Gays and Awkway. Sorry, where are you? North of Gennan Awkway, Ontario, leads in the thousands. Gennan Awk? Yeah. Yeah, do you service out this way? Yes, we do. Okay, interesting. Yeah, I have a, I live in the country obviously and currently and there was central air here, but the central air unit is stopped working and leaked out all the cool. Right? So you either need a new central air unit or possibly a heat pump. Sure. And what do you have for heat and do you have a pernose? Yes, I just said they have a propane furnace. Okay. Now George, when you get a heat pump, it will be having one outdoor unit, which will be outside of your home and an indoor unit, which will be connected to your pernose. And through the dockwork, it's going to be providing you with both Colleen and Heden. Yes. Okay. Do you know about heat pumps a bit? I do. I understand right? They work to a certain temperature for heating purposes. I do have a wood stove, which is pretty much my primary source of heat for the house of furnaces, kind of our backup since we've installed the wood stove. Right? Sure. Now, I would just like to let you know about some of the updates in the market. There you should be, how some there you should be rebate program, which ended on January this year. However, for homeowners who miss that on the rebate, government extended an interest-free funding program. So as per which, they have a criteria, if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at zero percent interest rate. And you give this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. Did you know about this before? No, I did not realize that. Yeah. No, I didn't. Interesting. Sure. What I can do is, like, I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors, show this causes program with you, annual providing with the price and the product for a heat pump as well. Okay. That would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Not an issue. Tell me a bit about your home, like it's a bungalow, like just one main floor or two floors. How is it like? It has one main floor in the basement, right? It's a small home just under 1,500 square feet. It's not an open concept, right? Like we have existing ductwork and the propane furnace. So we have a wood stove in the basement. We have a two ton AC unit originally that kept the house pretty cold, but it broke right away and leaked all the coolant out. And I understand the replacement for an AC unit around 5 grand, but I understand. He pumps generally run probably close to 10,000, but are much more efficient. They are much more efficient and we do actually provide kind of like a very good discount. It's not going to be a close 10,000 actually. It's going to be a bit lower. But yeah. Yeah. So when was your house built? I don't know the exact date, but it was built at least 30 more years ago. That's newer windows, but the installation is like it wasn't an R2000 home. It doesn't have vapor barrier. It has the drywall with like 10 foil on the back. So I renovated your bathroom and I removed all the drywall and re-insulated and stuff. So I'm very good. Yeah, inside the wall. I'm looking to do a roof. It's kind of one of those. Do I do my roof this year or do the air conditioning this year? You know, I would love to have the money to do both, but you don't know if I could try to do that. I'm not sure if I can afford that. I know I can afford that. Sure. Okay. And how old is the furnace? I know you don't use it a much, but still like how old is the product? The furnace was converted to propane. I believe it was oil previously. I'm not sure, but it was converted in 2008. Oh, it's pre 2008. So the house is your primary residence and you are the owner, right? Yes. Yes. And what's the average monthly electricity bill just a rough idea? It's gone up since we installed the hot tub, but it's roughly around $125 a month. And how much does the wood cost you annually? The wood every year. Well, our first year. I'd say it's about 1350 for the wood for the wood stove. Do you pay anything for propane every year or no? We do. We do pay for propane every year. It's about roughly $500 every time you show the tanks. And since we use the wood stove, we've filled the tanks twice. So we're spending it because we heat our water with propane as well. Oh, okay. Yeah, we have a propane hot water tank. So we run about $1,000 a year for propane for heat and hot water. Okay. Got it. When we used just the furnace and not the wood stove, our bills were $2500 a year for propane. Oh, wow. Yeah. I had a client the other day who was saying like a $3,500 per year. And even the oil people, they kind of like sometimes they pay $6,000 a year. I'm like, okay, that's a lot. It's crazy that those kind of prices right? And I just thought since when the country with power outages out here, a wood stove was, you know, unnecessary backup. But I understand these heat pumps are very efficient. Uh-huh. You know, we're good part of the year with the heat pump and not. But I also thought there was a company near me that was talking about you get a free AC if you buy it in furnace and my furnace being 15 years old. What should I do here? You know, I'm sure you know, I'd love to have your people who know what they, you know, understand these things, give us advice on, you know, do use the furnace as well. You know, um, turn one up. Yeah, um, you know, when someone comes and looks at it, they'll, you know, probably give us the advice on what we should do there. We like to be self sufficient here. Right? Let's go and try. Yeah, we're my wife's semi retired and, you know, I'll be retiring in a few years. So we would like to monthly bills to be lower. Yeah, I see. Sure. Um, can I give your exact address like exact address of the house? Yeah. Yeah. It's 3331 County Road 3 and it's Lindhurst, Ontario. Okay. And the postal code is KOE 1 and 0. Okay. Thank you for that. Got it here. So now for the online meeting, George, um, first of all, as I said, I'm going to schedule for a talk with one of our advisors. The platform we use is it is Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. It's going to be online. Yeah. Yeah. Once we get to know about the price, you get to know about the product that we offer you like everything, you can pick any day and time for in person inspection in your place. Okay. Okay. Great. Yeah. All right. So, um, awesome. Can we look into, um, tomorrow like 4 p.m. Is that a good time with you at all or no? Um, I'm off work at 4, but I'm generally driving. I think we at home till about 5. Okay. Or we could do it in the morning tomorrow, say 10 a.m. I have only one spot for tomorrow. That's 4 p.m. If you're not available, it's all good. We can look into Monday. Is that okay with you? Sure. That'd be fine with me. Monday, I can do like 1, 2, 4, 6. How about 1? Sure. I just booked an answer for Monday 1 p.m. Then I'm going to send you Google Meet Invite right now. She can save a terror calendar. And on Monday morning, I'll email you the Google Meet link as well. So you can join us at 1 p.m. using your phone or a computer. It's up to you. Okay. Yeah. I can probably use my phone if I'm on the road or my laptop at work. Right? Sure. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. My pleasure. Thank you for your time. We'll talk to you on Monday 1 p.m. Then. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. All right. Thanks. My pleasure. Bye bye now. Bye bye.",651.6779138321996,-0.0002191206440329552,0.948534369468689,-0.9601548910140991,0.08808284997940063,326.5056689342404,0.2841998159320994,0.569465237299883
20240523-185219_2207_+16478797993_Outgoing_Auto_2198136930043.mp3," Hello. Oh, hi, is it better now? Yeah, it's good now. Awesome. Okay, so as I was saying, where was I? I say like it has an absolutely enough app. Yeah, once it reaches to minus 27, then the furnace can start. Yeah, exactly. Once it goes like beyond minus 25, the heat pump is going to shut down and the furnace is going to start working. So you use your furnace only when it's very cold outside. So that's how with the heat pump, you'll be saving almost 80% on your gas bill. Because you're using your furnace only when it's very cold, right? Right. Now, the cool part of the heat pump is it's kind of like almost the same as an AC or a bit more efficient. Like, for example, if the Sierra value for the normal ACs in Canada here is 14 Sierra value, heat pump, Sierra value is 16. So yeah. And that's it. That's a bit of a heat pump. And there are like, there used to be a rebate program before, which actually ended on January the year. However, there is still another incentive program for heat pumps, which is through Canada Green Air Homes. So, like, if you qualify, they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at 0% interest rate. And you get the interest free money for a period of 10 years. Now, the good thing about this program is you can qualify for up to 40,000. You don't necessarily need to use all of that, but that's what you can qualify up to. Okay. That is all like interest free. Yeah. Okay. So, so, like, do I have to apply for that? Or you will be like, you'll be helping me out to a new case. Yeah. We have like a separate like team for that. We call it as account coordinators. They actually deal with the whole paperwork of the this program and deal with it. So you don't need to do it yourself. We do it. We do take care of it. But that's something else. I also heard that. I also heard that like once after installing the heat pump, the companies will give me a break of up to three months. So, like, I don't have to pay anything immediately. Like after three months, I have to start paying. And within that three months, I'll get the money from the government and then pay up few. And then I have to start the installments, plans for the government. You said something like true. I have no idea about it. There used to be like something through finance. Finance IP, which is still the use, which gives you like a six months. I believe it's still going on. But that's like for six months, you don't pay anything. And then you start payment. Like, start payment. Which company. Which company are you calling from? I'm calling from the very good home. What's that? Weaver like W-E-A-D-E-R. Weaver, E-C-O-S-E-C-O, and home like home. So it's Weaver, E-C-O-H-O. We're in Northears, Toronto. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I actually honestly speaking, I'm not sure about the payment stuff. Like, I don't know that part of it. Like, I work as an appointment booker. I can schedule you for a talk with one of our advisors. She can discuss that with you in detail. Okay. Perfect. Sounds good. You also do like the free estimation, like the consultation to my home. Yeah. Like the only thing is what we do is, the J is paid or the NA. My bad. Sorry. Your name was the NA or the J? Oh, Vinay. Vinay, sorry. Okay. Vinay. So we do like the consultation like this as an online. Like we use the platform of Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. Since the online meeting, we provide you with the price, the product, our services. If you like it, you like the price, you like the product. You can pick any day and time for in-person inspection in your place. So before coming to your place, you will be having an idea of what we offer and how much. Okay. Okay. Can we do that tomorrow or it's actually morning? We don't work on weekends. But tomorrow we can look into some time like. Because I'm at the new house and I don't, I didn't got any laptop or. Like I don't have access to my laptop right now. So if I connect over the. You can connect with your phone. Yeah. You have your phone, you have an internet right to just go to your email and you can join us with it. That's not an issue. I can help you with that part. That should be okay. It's just about the timing late. What time you're available. Let me see. Tomorrow you said right? Yes. How about early in the morning? What time you guys start? Yeah. We work like on Fridays. We work like 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Unfortunately for tomorrow the 11 is booked. So I can look into a 12 1 2 4 and 5 like this. All right. Let's do 12 then. Okay. Awesome. So okay.

I mean, did the technician explain how the product works? Yeah. And how do you rate out the technician on the scale of 1 to 5? Uh, that is a tough one because when we had the technician install it, uh, he had to go down the road and connect it through a different person's area and run a wire over to where ours is. And then another technician or someone had come out afterwards and found out that the connection is right. So, we don't have to have a wire that runs all over the place. So, they missed that. But, uh, I'm going to need to get another technician out here to just connect it from our own outlet to the house. Oh. Instead of having a wire that runs all over the place. Oh, sir, I will do that after the call. So, how would you rate out the technician on the scale of 1 to 5? Uh, you know, we'll give him a three because he missed a pretty big issue. And, uh, he could have connected it from our own outlet instead of going all the way down the road. So. All right, sir. Thank you for your positive feedback, sir. Uh, sir, should you have any concern or question? Please do not hesitate to call contact us at 123 at 1 8 0 0 4 4 8 7 2 4. So, now please, uh, could you please tell me what is the issue? So, I could write it down in the notes and send it to the dispatch team. Uh, we just need, um, a new wiring in from the, uh, the connection because we have it connected down the road at a neighbor's. Property and the wire goes to our property, but there's a closer outlet that, uh, the technician is supposed to come or he said that someone would come, but it never happened. And it's at our property. So. Oh, yes, sir. I said, but actually, uh, like we do, uh, HVAC services. It is from the Canadian telephone services. Did the technicians miss it up all these things? Yeah. Yeah. The technician had come by to test that he would send someone out. So, I was, I was going to make a call to get somebody out here to, uh, to fix that off at some point, but I just hadn't got around to it yet. Got it, sir. I'm just going to write it down in the notes and send it to the dispatch team and the dispatch team will contact you and hire, uh, and they will assign a technician and send you sounds good. That's awesome. I really appreciate you doing that for us. Yes, sir. I'm just going to do it right, right away. Okay. Thank you so much, sir. And sir, okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

So, that's another program going on. And the only like good thing which I like about it is you can qualify for a higher amount of money. Like, you can qualify for up to 40,000.

You should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. Yeah. And the house shouldn't be a new build because new build houses do not qualify. It should be like at least six months old. No, this is a 30-year-old home. So, we're okay on that. All right. And it shouldn't be a condo or a apartment. It should be a house. Yep, they should attach home. Awesome. And you should be a Canadian citizen or PR holder with a very credit score, no bankruptcy. That's perfect. It's not based on income or anything else.

Yeah, it has like an application that you need. Like, we actually do that. Like, we sell the application and apply for it to see if you get approved or no.

I have a question. I have a question. I have a question. Have you done any inquiry about getting more information on a heat pump? On a more information on a heat pump. I didn't get that. Oh, gotcha. Because heat pump is usually devised like gives you heating and cooling for the home. It is far more efficient than furnaces and ACs. Were you online on Facebook looking at any ads or any inquiries that you have done about it? About the home. You moved for a heating and cooling. Yes. Yes. I have one install. She is very happy with it. That was great. How long ago did you get install? I think it was DMK install. My little mom. She has got it done too. She has got it done. Yes. Really happy. So much. That I have been taking it. My case when I bought this price. It is fixed here. The whole process is all rusty. The furnace. Again, it means that the house is a... Let me see. For people who are handicapped people. I am not handicapped. It was built like the hall of the wiser. Everything accommodates. We are sure to get from the car. To the door. From the deck. You can go outside. I think that the people who lived there did not really maintain it. I installed a new furnace. This was a clearing system. I think both of them cost me 12,000. It was six years ago. I was going to go to the house. That is where I would have jumped to. Completely bad. How much would it cost me? I found it. It is almost new. Perfect. It is about 15,000. It is about 15,000. The two floors. It is huge. That is a lot. We are going to have to pay attention to the price. We are going to have to pay attention to the price.

You can see the problem in my half. But I would get the hell out of it, then I'll fit out of it. Because this awareness I have, the carrier, the infancy system, the same with the air conditioner. It's like it's running and you go to the other house. Yeah? Like it's unknown. Yeah, because I see code of the cooler as coming out of the vent. Yeah, so, yeah, so, yeah, so how much do they usually cost? Let me see, because it's... They're going to be the ones who have all the info. All I do is I just set the appointment for them, just so they can go over everything. And then we feel it's playing out a lot better, give you a prize. I give you an update because there's been a lot of updates with government incentives. They're going to be the ones who want to be able to give you all of that. Just to kind of see how far you are.

It was built in 2016. It's about 16 years old now. Maybe 16 or 18 years old. And on average, just to see if the heat pump is something that it will give you guys value to the home in terms of utility bills. How much are you guys spending on hydro every month on electricity? You are... I pay attention to... I pay everything automatically. So you know, it just glends for the... It's about the same thing. That's okay. And I tend to keep the house warmer than the average person. Oh, perfect. Frank, just tomorrow at 12 o'clock, is that a... Would that work for you? Yeah, does that get up on... I have... I... Let me see. I thought there was something... Towards the front floor, is it? That should be alright. Perfect.

Fine, thank you. How are you? I'm good. Thank you for asking. I'm just calling in regards to your online inquiry about a heat bump. Yes. And I wanted to find out exactly what is the heat bump. Is it something? Well, you tell me. Sure, it does both the heat and coolant. So you can use it both in summer for coolant and in winter for heat and. It has an outdoor lens. Is that one of the ones that go over the window? Do you have a door? Do you have a door? Do you have like a front house? No, I have a boiler. Okay. And I have three units that are inside the house over the windows. So I think it is the same thing. The other one is the heat and cool. But the person who I bought them from, I don't have any contact with. I don't know where they are. So I wondered if this was the same thing. I believe so. It is kind of like a mini splet that gets mounted to the wall. Like that wall can be like any wall. It doesn't have to be like over the window. Yeah. Can you like any wall. So do you have one of them? Yes. Oh, I see. So that is actually the darkness heat bump. I believe. I don't know. I don't have any dust work. Yeah. It has a compressor outside. Yeah, exactly. That is the same thing. Okay. Wonderful. Okay. So what are you looking for? I am looking to see because at the time, I only needed it in the three bedrooms. And now I wanted to see if it was possible to get an old for having it to put it this way. We have got two on the main floor and one upstairs. I have two bedrooms upstairs that need to be cool. And I also need the main floor downstairs to be cool. Sure. Okay. So you have like just one main floor and a top floor. That is the house. Yeah. Okay. So one bedroom upper floor and then the living space downstairs. Yeah. I have three bedroom upstairs, two with you in the unit. Okay. Two of them. Okay. Yeah. And then the main floor. Sure. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors. She will provide you with the price and the product that we offer. And meanwhile, there is an incentive program available for heat pumps. Have you heard of that? Or no? Not at all. No worries. It is basically through Greeners' home, like a federal program. Is it called Greener High? Yeah. Can I look at the Greener High? It is called the little FICY story. No worries. So if you qualify, they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump in your home at 0% interest rate. So whatever is the price, you will give the same money from government at 0% interest. And you give this interest free money for a period of 10 years. It is a little bit of a lot of that. Yeah. So you can discuss that as well. And then you can see if it is something you want to take advantage of as well. Okay. Okay. Okay. So Austin, tell me a bit about your home. When was it built? Like what year? Oh my gosh. My house has got to be. It is a post-war home. So it has got to be over 50 years old. If it doesn't have a furnace, it has a boiler. Is that a lake on gas or electricity? It is on gas. Okay. And what is this core footage of the house? Like how big is it? Any idea? It is strong. I am guessing. I am really bad. I would say 1400 square feet to the same. No problem. Sure. And the system that you have right now, the UNEPS. How old are those? The furnace that I have, what the units? Yes. The units are probably four years old. Okay. And the house of your primary for our last church. My primary residence. Yeah. And you are the homeowner, right? Yes. Okay. What is the average monthly electricity and gas bill? It is a rough idea. Oh, honey, I can even tell you. No worries. It is okay. So the email address, what I have here, it is your first name, dot your last name, one at gmail.com. Correct? That is correct. And the home address, what I have here, it is only on perio. Can I get the exact address please? It is 736. Hmm? Pous, Pellum Road, T-E-L-H-A-M Road. Hmm? In the well, that is W-E-L-L-A-N-D. Okay.

So, yeah, the ad says, can you like, do you like recall exactly what the ad was saying or no? I don't know. I couldn't tell you, but it was something about rebates. So, I hope to find brand or something. Okay, sure. The rebates are, as I said, only for Enbridge users. And it's kind of like based on the ton of a heat bump, like for every half ton, there is 250, 250 crap. So for two ton, it's going to be only 500 grand. So two ton, okay. Let me see, because I actually had another company just come and give me a quote. So 18,000 BTU. I don't know what, so yeah, I don't have a ton on there.

It doesn't say any tons. How I see. But do you have like duck work in your home? Do you have a furnace or now? Yeah, we do. Okay. Did they quote you on something duckless? Did I? I think I have a half of my house is not ducked. I have a large house, so half of it is boiler and half of it is forest air. Okay. All right. So you're looking to like get duckless units only for that specific area, which has my duck work. Okay. So how many heads you're actually looking into? I think four. Okay. Well, it's not the heads or not. That's not how they, I'm kind of confused. Does somebody planning on coming out? I think I made an appointment for Tuesday. What are your company? Well, I made a company with some, I mean an appointment with somebody that's coming out on Tuesday. And it was from Facebook, so I assumed it was you guys. Oh, no, it wasn't us because I'm like the appointment with her for the company. So I'm like, I haven't talked to you before. Oh, okay. We do like virtual meeting like Google meets, in which we provide it with the co-tons because the whole process. And if you like it, then we'd be the next step in person. But that's like an easy problem. Yeah. Okay. So what do they give me here? It's not, it's not heads. It's a unit in the attic that there's only one head inside. Okay. Because you're talking about the unit that is a wall right? Yes. Yeah. No, there's only one of those. But you know what? As far as the rebates are concerned, they have like a specific kind of like qualification. Like if you want to put like dockless heat pump like the heads, the one that's mounted there, well, you need to have them like one per floor in order to qualify for a rebate. Did you know about this? No, but there is one. There is one, there's just one for you. One for four. So there is one in the master bedroom. And then the other ones just have what is it called? I don't know. I just used the long rope here. So yeah, there's different, like it's just like a duck in a way that's in a room ceiling. Anyway, I don't really have time for this now. I was just going out the door. I'm leaving out of country. So if you want to book something or you want to call, give me a call next week, Tuesday, can we get that shopping up? Yes, that's what I'll go back to next week Tuesday then. Okay? Sure. Thanks. Thanks. Bye bye now.

So you heard from Amy and she's asking for a five-digit code. Yeah, I have no idea what that means. Okay. So what they're telling us is when we sign in for your Lennox, it won't allow us because you haven't actually registered it. So what it says. Okay. So it says when you go on your screen of your Lennox, are you at home right now? Yeah. Okay. It says when you go on the screen, does it say select generate pin at the bottom of the screen? Let me just go because I am on the cell phone so I'll go to the thermal care. Perfect. Because all I'm doing is I'm just looking it up online to see how to do it because we don't use a lot of Lennox. So we're not that familiar with them, but it does say when we go in that it wants a five-digit unique pin number will appear. Now, maybe I see that. So telling me on your screen at the bottom of the screen, like if you go to when you go to install. I'm not there. See what my main screen is. Is there a settings button? There is a button. Then you okay. Are they settings? Yes. Okay. Got a setting seat that says anywhere to. It says generate pin. This is the second Wi-Fi away current temperature and humidity notifications devices. Add device. It says add device. That's all it says. No, but that's not right. I'm not. It says under just a system. So it means I'm the district. So when we go in, like if you go online and you type it in, it tells us it wants a five-digit pin, which is. Is the number that it gives you? Should I try to go on a bad setting? I do not know. No, I don't know. Give me one second. I'm just looking at this site. I mean, be in the support access. Notifications. Okay. Let me go back into Linux log in. So when I go into Linux log in, I put your email. Okay. No. Okay. Get him get out. So now you can't even sit in. You know what, as soon as that day, he was saying something about five digits, then he says, oh no, no, no, no, I don't need it. Yeah, you need to put the pen. That's how you're registered for us to be or anybody to be able to tell you. How do I do that? I see the thing is I know a little bit of computers, but I am not the Linux person. Should I call or should I do? Okay, give me a moment. Let me see if I can get you the Linux phone number where they can help you out while you're there. You know what I mean? Okay, so you want to connect to the human. I can't connect you. I can give you the number. So you just give them a call and say that you cannot find your five digit code. They will guide you on how to do it. Just a minute. Okay. It's nothing to go on. It's not on the box or anything because like you have no. No, it says here when I go on it. It says where is it? I'll give you a second. See, I remember as I was saying something about five digits, and then he says, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay now. Yeah, no, you need it. So I don't know why he did that. Okay, try this. How can I help me? Okay, no, no, no. How to find my pen for my Linux thermostat. Go to menu. Go to menu. Okay, I was just going to hit on the phone. You okay? Stay on the phone. I got the steps here. So go to menu. I'm going to go. I just was thinking I'm going into. Okay, go into. Where does menu. It says more menu. Okay, my home menu. Okay. And then go to user account. User settings. There's no user account. I see notifications user setting, display settings, a Linux dealer support access, mode, schedule, fan, and settings. What's the user setting? Okay, try to use a setting. And then does it say, is there on there? And one that says account now when you're on there? It says user account. Go to account. Okay. And now do you see? It says my name. My phone number. It says change password. Change email. Says ID. Okay. At the bottom does it say select generate pen. No credit at the bottom of the screen. No, at the bottom you say log out or delete account. No, don't want you to do that. Okay. It says go to menu. User account. Then go to account and select generate pen at the bottom of the screen. You can use it account. But see, it doesn't give me that option what you're saying. It just gives me first name, last name, phone number, change password, change email, and then it says log out or delete account. Okay. Okay. I can go to the term with that because I am on the phone right now. I can try to go to the term with that. You're not on the thermostat right now. No, no, no, you got to go to the thermostat.

Your thermostat is registered with your user account. Okay, so at the bottom of the screen, does the show select generate pen? Because when we go on to the Linux to sign in, it wants a five digit code. I use account notifications, schedules, fan settings, diverse support access, display settings. Now see, I don't get that when I go into the menu, I going to a user account and all it gives me. Like under like on the left side, it is alert and before forming for help and support tutorials. When you go to user account, is there a spot that you can select a count again? Like another account like account or no. You just say account and then okay, it says email is formula alarm and email.com. I can press that and see what happens. Well, it doesn't say to do that. It just says at the bottom of the screen, it should say generate pen. No, I don't have it. You don't have it. Okay, so you're going to have to give them a call, I believe. And then at least they can help you. And then once you get that pen, then we can help you from here. Okay, give me the phone number. Okay, so it's one, 800, 953, 6669. Any option? I doesn't tell me on here, it just gives me that number. So you'll just go to technical support. But yeah, how do I find my pen for my Linux thermostat? I'm just going to miss that home screen, go to menu, user account, then account, and then it says select your pen at the bottom of the screen. Yeah, exactly. I don't know if I can find out. Yeah, they would be able to see we're not Linux, right? So I can't, I can only guide you to a certain point. Okay. Yeah. So if you give them a call, once you get that five digit code, give us a call, and we can monitor it from here. Yeah, see that even the day like today, when the template is outside is, I don't know what the template is outside is, it will not go below 22.5. Right. Okay, so something's going on, but we have to see what's going on. Okay, so you can give us, yes. And then just either call me or text, say me the number, and then we can look at it and have our text, to look at it for you from here. Okay, but I remember us and my saying something, but he ignored it. Okay, well, we're not going to ignore it. So let's, let's not, we're not going to ignore it. So get that code for us, and then we can help you out. Okay. Okay. All right. Amazing. Okay, thank you.

20240523-125005_2208_+19057011372_Outgoing_Auto_2198021573043.mp3," Hello. Hi, they're good to see you. My name is Nick Adonifer. This is she. Hi, Adonifer. This is Mariam calling from Wee Reacle home. Just calling you because we received an inquiry that you had interest in a heat pump. Well, I wanted to get more information. Yeah, for sure. So what we do is we'll book you in for virtual appointment with one of our advisors and then that way they'll go over all the details. Just to let you know there have been some changes in the market. So the government in the past was offering rebates, but they have transitioned that over to the funding program at 0% interest for 10 years. Have you heard of that? Well, yes, no. I wasn't clear on whether that was still available as well. Okay. So my thing is very simple. My understanding is that you need to do that first before you can hire a contractor to do the work, correct? Like as far as the application goes? Yeah. Like the applications alone has to be all approved. I'm definitely looking at a loan. I'm not looking to just buy this out right now. So that would be a component of whatever I do. So my understanding is that you need to do the application for the loan first in order for you to then go with a heat pump. But what I didn't know was, is there still a pre-evaluation requirement to be done or no for the loan? You do need to get an energy audit done. Okay. So we're like we're licensed and you know across all of our Ontario not just for providing heat pumps, but we work with most of the major auditing companies. Okay. As well as the whole government process. So what I can do, Jennifer, I can book in for like it's a free consultation or free appointment with advisor will go through basically the process and all the information because we all help with all of the steps for the application as well. Right. Okay. And they have only extended it for a short period of time because they have advised us that they are going to be closing out that program soon as well. Okay. So what I can do, I just have to gather just some details regarding the home. Are you what's your current like heating source right now? Propane. Propane. Okay. When you think because the whole oil thing, I understand that they're doing that program with oil. I'm going to talk to the oil. This is propane and this like my protein is just out of control how much I spend in this house. Yeah. No, I hear you. Okay. So how old are your furnace? My furnace is only a couple years old now. Okay. It's not too bad. And what's the proximate square footage of the home? It's probably around 2500, 2600. Okay. 600. Okay. Okay. Okay. And three. How old was the furnace again? About two years old. Three. Three. Okay. Yeah. So just make the press that there. And then 2600 square feet. And I'm assuming you're the homeowner and this is your primary residence? Yes. Perfect. And I don't have an address here on file. What's your address? It's 65049, Marshagan, which is M-A-R-S-H-A-G-A-N, Road. And that's Wayne Fleet. Although Mali Address comes in as Dunville. Dunville. Okay. Yeah, but we live in the County of Wayne Fleet. Okay. And N1A-2W-2. 2W-2. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then let me just see if there's anything else that we... Oh, what's your average? What would you say the average propane bill is especially in the winter time? You mean how much do I... Like, are you asking me like each time I fill it? Or are you talking about... Yeah. It costs me about 1,200 probably to fill it? 1,200, okay. And I guess on average when I do with people on propane or oil, it obviously depends on the winter. But then you wear between at least three, four times, you guys fill it? Or... It's about three times... Yeah, I'd say three to four times for the year, depending on how it goes. Yeah. Okay. That we are on propane for other things during the year. Right. Okay. That makes sense. And then what's the proximate... Or sorry, you said 2,600 square feet. Is it a two-story polluted patch? Yeah. It's a two-story with a walk-up attic. Okay. Perfect. Okay, perfect. So I think that's the main things that we're gathering on the home here. So what I'll do, Jennifer, now we... I can book you in with the advisor. We do it through... It's a virtual meeting. So it would be done through Google meets kind of similar to like a Zoom. Right. And... And try that. Well, it will work, but I can try it. You live in a little nowhere and our internet service is pretty awful. Okay. Yeah, but I mean we can certainly try. Yeah, we can try. Worst case, the advisor will give you a call and we can either try to help you get on or if you're having internet connection, then we can try to do the over-the-phone. Right. But I just want to confirm I have your email address here as undercoat of snow altogether at gmail.com. Yeah, that's correct. Okay, so that's what we'll be emailing it to. Yeah. And then... So let me look at the schedule here. And let's see what availability there is. Okay. I do have availability tomorrow at one o'clock. What's Friday? Yeah, I can probably do that, although next week is probably better. Or actually do you see there is one just opened up for today at 4pm. I don't know if that's too short notice. Yeah, four would be horrible. Let's just do the one at 1pm tomorrow. One at 1pm? Yeah. Okay, because my bus gets home at 4pm. Okay, gotcha. Okay, no worries. So I booked it in tomorrow at 1 o'clock. What will happen is you'll get a Google Meet, yeah, a link to your email address. And we usually give you a show in the morning, like one of our appointment bookers will give you a show to maybe tomorrow morning just to confirm. Right. Yeah, that would be fine. So what I would suggest is that, you know, I'll try to do the link. And if that doesn't work then you guys can just call me. So just so that we're clear, because at this point, like, I'm interested in quotes. Like, I'm not one of these people that just goes with one company and says, okay, that's what I want to do. So I'm looking at getting quotes from different companies. I assume that's not an issue with you guys. Yeah, yeah. So the advisor will go over like the package, the quotes, like they're the cost, but also importantly, the whole, like the incentive loan process, because it is, you know, there's certain requirements that we're clear. Yeah, a lot. So, yeah, so don't worry that that's the main thing. And the reason we do it, your Google Meet, just because they'll make kind of an analysis for your particular home and present it to you. Right. Okay. Just a couple other questions. Just, will I have you on the phone? And I mean, certainly they can go into more detail with me tomorrow. But so my understanding with the loan is that they can give a maximum up to 40,000, not that I'm not really looking for that, but that is my understanding. Is that correct? Yeah, so it's up to 40,000. And what, there's, cannot cover. I know that one is a heat pump, but is there any other things that can be covered on that? Because I do understand that you can make the application for the loan, and you can only do it one time. And then that will cover whatever. But if you're telling me that, you know, it's potentially closing as well, I just want to know what else it covers. Yeah, good question. So, main thing is heat pump, solar panels, windows and doors, water heater. Those are the main product stuff, great. Okay. And for the water heater, is there any requirement that that has to be on oil before or no? No, no, no. Okay. And can that, does that also include like tankless water heaters? Tankless water heaters are not for whatever reason, they're not part of the, are eligible. Okay. There is one water heater, which I can make a quick note of on the advisor to explain it to you. It's a heat pump water heater. Okay. It's the most efficient water heater out there, and of course it's a legible. So I can make a note of that Jennifer, then we'll go over like very quickly what the details are, the cost on that as well. Okay. And then you mentioned before you guys don't do the energy audit, but you have a list that you can provide, is that correct for auditors? We have, we work with most of the major auditing companies across Ontario, so we would be the ones who book like coordinating with the auditors directly. I think that's helping you through that. And again, the advisor will explain that to you tomorrow as well. Okay. All right. Do you have a rough cost on that? Because I know again, like those are independent, so there are different prices. The water heater? No, the audit. Oh, the audit is usually, like it's a general, for to cover both audits because you have to get to write your pre and your post. It's about 700 or 750. That cover is both audits. Okay. Because I know when I went on the website, I was actually on there last night, they have, I know I just love the government. I used to be a government worker, that's a sad part, but it's just crazy to me because when you go on there, for the loan and everything, it will tell you click this so you can get like these auditors, right, where you can go. But the only link that they have is to Enbridge. And Enbridge is doing them anymore. Yeah, exactly. Who do you go to? Yeah, it's tricky on the government website, especially because they've made so many changes recently. Yeah, they're not very helpful unless you're building a house and you have, like not building a house, but unless you have like a contractor, right? Yeah, it's not easy. It's just an individual person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So that's a good thing with us is we take care of that whole process. Right. Okay. We'll explain that to you tomorrow. And just very quickly, I do have to jump off because I have another appointment. What's the, what's the, what's the, of your home, like what's the year, sorry? I 1890. 1890. It's a mom. It's perfect. Yeah, I know where you need everything. Like, every. Yeah, yeah, I hear you. Okay. Awesome. So I have you booked in for tomorrow at one o'clock. You'll, you should receive the link shortly in your email and we'll give you a confirmation call tomorrow morning and posting it. Okay. You'll be updated tomorrow at one o'clock. Okay. Can I answer that for one other question before I go off just, it came to mind. With Windows indoors, if you're going to the loan process, do you have to replace like all your windows that are bad or can you just replace part? No, you can just replace part. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I can find out because we don't deal with Windows and Moors. Right. You're sick to all the pump and the water heater heat pump if you go that route. Yes. But you can also do the audit and the audit with cover if you did Windows and doors through somebody else. Correct. Yeah. And we also hope with the whole application, like we have a whole department that walks you through the whole application process. Right. So we can help you with the application for other products even if we don't offer the product. Right. Yeah. Windows is like, I'm sumbling with the whole window and door thing because I just hate that industry. It's like my pet peeve. They're just, they're so like out of control price mark and it's just so hard to get quotes without having to have like 50,000 million different groups coming in, which is just the nightmare. Yeah. I have got that. Okay. I do have to, I'm so sorry. Okay. No, that's fine. Thank you so much. Yeah. I'll leave the note and show over all of that with you. Okay. Sounds good. I'll see you next time. Have a good night. Talk to you next time.

20240523-132835_2207_+16477186300_Outgoing_Auto_2198036275043.mp3," Hello. Hello, my name is Tegan to the vendor. Yes. Hi, this is Hussna Collins from Weaver, Ika, home. I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Oh, one last. Hello. Yeah, hello. I will guide your inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Are you looking to get a hit bump in your own? Hit bump? No. Yes. Hit bump? No. No, hit bump. For sure, it's not there. Do you know what it is? What do you call a hit bump? I have no idea. Okay. It does like hidden and cool and it works both like an AC as well as a furnace. It's just like one product that does two jobs. And there is like an incentive program through jobs when available for a hit bump slow. What are you looking into? You can make a garden with it. If we wanted to have it like how much it's going to be cost. Well, it totally depends. It depends on the product as well as its core footage of your house. So what is this core footage? How big is the house? How big is the house? 16 70s care for 1700. 1700? 1700? Yes. And what do you guys have right now? Do you have a furnace? Do you have an AC or no? What do you have? Old furnace and new AC. New AC and old furnace. Old furnace. So I see. Now, you know what? When you get a heat bump, it gets connected to the furnace. So you don't need to remove your furnace unless you have any issue with it. But the heat pump replaces the AC. So. Okay. Yeah. And how much it's going to be cost? It could range. Yeah, like I can give you like a range that would be anywhere from 4500 to 6500. Pan. Tanthali Soto. Pan. So that's good. You need to use it outside. You need to use it outside. Actually, heat and AC would be outside of the house. It has an outdoor unit that's going to be outside your home. And one indoor unit that's going to be inside, it gets connected to the furnace. And through the dock work, it's going to provide you with both heat and, in winter and cool in and summer. So it does like two jobs, like two things and one product just one outdoor one indoor unit. That's it. Okay. Okay. Connect the furnace to the furnace. So you don't need to use the furnace to connect to the furnace. No furnace. Then I'll connect to the furnace. AC. AC. AC. The load need to bend. That means the unit is going to be outside the house. And AC is going to be working. So the furnace is going to be connected to the furnace. Dancing resistance. Challenge. possible? No inside things. The inside is like very tiny, it's just like a coil and it gets connected to the furnace. It's kind of like pretty small. Like how much is space it gonna take inside? How much is space? Yes. I have no idea. Honestly, I don't know. Like a box one? Like a box? Yeah, you can, you know what you can like to see it? You can just Google it. You can Google like indoor unit of a heat pump or coil of heat pumps. You can see the size of it. Because I can't like, but it's small. It's not like big. Oh, okay, okay. Pretty small. Okay. And for incentive, you guys gonna apply it, we gonna go ahead with you guys. Oh, yeah, we take care of the paperwork, everything for the incentive. Do you know what the incentive is or no? No. Oh, I think. So what, what going to be incentive? Yeah, it's basically, there used to be like a rebate program which ended on January this year. But for homeowners who miss out on the rebate, government expanded an interest-free funding program. Like if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at zero-person interest. And you give this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. So for example, if the heat pump is gonna cost you 5,000, government will give you that 5,000 without any interest. And you have to, you have a period of 10 years up to 10 years. Yes, up to 10 years. And the good thing is you can qualify for up to $40,000. You don't necessarily need to use all of it, but that's why you can qualify up to this. If you're looking to do any other upgrades in your home, like changing your windows or doing your, I don't know, water tank or anything else, you can use the money for as a well. So it's not just for heat pump. You can like do multiple upgrades. It's up to you. Then they, after that we have to return it in 10 years. We need to return it without any interest. Without any interest. Exactly. Okay. Or a bet is gone. They said the bet is gone in like, but you can, you can, government so, you know up to 40,000. That's the quality. Nothing going on here. Nothing going on here. But I mean, you know, you know, do you know that is there any possibility that anything going on here, or going to be coming soon or any idea? Yeah, honestly speaking, we can't say exactly like when it's going to be back. We can't tell that. But for Enbridge users, like people who have Enbridge gas, some incentive is coming back, but it's not going to be the same way as it used to be. For example, before it was like 6000, right? The rebate. Now it's going to be only for Enbridge and it's going to be only 1500 or 2000 max. So it's not like the same way. It's going to be like very small amount. Okay, but this program will be available for you. Yeah, this program is available. Okay. We will call you back. We need to talk about it. And if we are interested, we'll give you a call back. May I know your name please? My name is Hussna. Hussna? Yes. Okay. Nice talking to you. Dear, we will call you. Absolutely. Thank you.

20240523-140536_2207_+12266277577_Outgoing_Auto_2198050303043.mp3," Hello. Oh my speaking to my old. I'm asked is calling. Yeah, hi. This is Hussmo, Colin from Weaver, Eka home. I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a hit bump. Oh, so this is for the greener homes grant. So I'm just basically what I'm wondering is. As I understand it, if I'm eligible for the greener homes grants, then that subsidizes some of the cost of the heat pump it and from what I've seen on the government's website, they can subsidize an offset up to 75% of the cost of the heat pump. I see. Or for customers of integrity or hydro one that get some of their heating from electricity currently as part of the Ontario energy efficiency program. Is that kind of correct is like some of these things are ringing about. Well, there is like an. Not as like there used to be like a greener homes grant like a rebate, which actually ended on January this year. It never like was fresh that or never came up with something different. There is like another. They actually did the heat the heat pump grant it's called something else is called the affordable energy. For a area or something program. What is for oil do you have oil for us? No, I don't have an oil furnace, but I do understand that there was an incentive to transfer from oil to heat pump. That's so tough. It's so tough. Yeah. Party. That's what the one for oil is still available. That's called as a freeability program. That's only for oil users. But for other like. If I have like union gap and the only way that I keep my home normally is through like union gas, which is now called amber. Yeah. Is there anything that heat pump is due for customer of an average gas where it's like a normal residential unit? There is like an average rebate program that's coming up pretty soon like start of June first week. We just like had a meeting like a couple days ago with the auditors. So there is a rebate coming up for an average users. And I know you have one. But the thing is it's not like the same way as it used to be like if you remember we used to have a rebate of 6,500 for an average before right now. It's only up to 2000. Yeah, I do understand that it's because I believe the heat the heat pump from what I understand it can assist the what you're already getting from and bridge and it doesn't directly compete with average. Is that correct? What thing I didn't get it. So like for instance, if I were to be a customer that that got like one of the units of like a heat pump, for example, it's something that could supplement the usage that or you could select the usage from that heat pump and it would simply use more electricity. And then you would have a lower gas bill and a lot of people would like kind of be turning that way due to the federal carbon tax and fear and creeps and things like that, right. And my generally kind of feeling like that's where my demographic would be if I were to be a customer and like sign up for that. Yeah, but as I understand the benefits are quite a bit more skewed in the favor of people that are using like oil and like things that are a little bit more dated in terms of like getting things from like an average or like out in the country or farmers agriculture stuff like that. I see. But for Ember to, I'm not sure. I'm just wondering what your experience. Yeah, sure. As I mentioned for oil like people use an oil furnace they have an advantage because they get a rebate of 10,000 and that's still available. It's been like available since last year. They never ever. I know. But that's only for oil. Oh, you know what? You know what? Somebody else. How would I determine that? Yeah, we always do an audit like whenever for any incentive you ever want to apply you do an energy audit which is conducted by a licensed author and they do a whole inspection. They want to check this. They will check the furnace. They asked for the bills of how many leaders of oil were used and how much they actually paid for and that's also kind of very much based on the income. They have like a kind of like strict criteria for oil for ability program. I did actually have one of them over for like a it was similar but it was like their subcontractors out for like heating and cooling. So of course they're incentivized to come by and do the inspection. And generally it's like they'll hire contractors that would want to pass eligibility. They have that they have some strict criteria. Obviously, but. Yeah. If somebody's inviting them over to do the audit, usually they meet the eligibility criteria. And they're like, you know, you know, you got to read it and call the number and it's just like a you'd kind of have to be asking for it if you were to invite the auditor over and if you knew you weren't. Yeah, they have a specific charge as well. Yeah. So it's also another. Sorry, what's that? There's like another incentive program that's supposed to be the greener homes. That's called as the greener homes loan. That's an interest free loan program. Like you can qualify for up to $40,000, which is totally interest free and you have a period of ten years. You don't need to use all of that for decay, but that's what you can qualify up to. And there are many like not as I do believe that I tried something like that with this central like cooling for the second building is I have two buildings on this property. And there is an incentive to do things like solar and stuff like that. So I've talked to like solar and can a few places, but I'm just curious because I might be I might be out of my I might be out of my. Lead here in terms of like what I'm understanding because I've never heard the term oil like furnace before. So just it seems to me like a gas. So if I'm using like a gas furnace to keep my. It's just like a very building. That's the same thing as an oil furnace or that distinctly different because that's what it seems like. It's just like a bigger and size that furnace itself and it runs on oil like the fuel is oil. It's not like gas or propane. That's it. People using it like areas that have no gas to use oil. That's why. Okay. So it's something that's on something that's rather uncommon or like maybe more rural areas would be adopting to this or like pain core places that were slightly less developed through emberage or union gas. Yeah. Okay. So this isn't something that's for everyone and there'd be a specific demographic to target with this is it usually people out in the country and they have like those big tankers. Like who did they deal with that would be supplying oil based like heating or do they source it themselves. I see. Or I'm just wondering does emberage provide oil based services for people? I have no idea. Okay. Have you heard of any of the companies that are providing like an oil based service because he said the auditor comes and they'll check out your bills and make sure that you're getting what you're paying for type of things. But I'm just wondering who would be the source of an oil based service to your home. I'm just curious because they may have more information on like whether or not certain properties qualify that I might be interested in letting some friends with my know about and then contact you to have. You can contact the auditing companies like they're like auditing companies like if you Google them like close by your area, you can contact them and then they can arrange like an audit that's like the person that's going to come and check the whole house and the phone has everything. Yeah, I think honey electric would be our regional one and some like like I forget the other two but it's a. I think they subcontract like local like honey electric limited and I think like hydro one people can come down but generally want to get like a mom and talk shop that's in that city. Because they get incentives for that if they if they help local businesses and that's so it's like it's a pretty efficient way to sell trickle down but I'm just wondering how. In your experience i'm not sure exactly if if you had been doing this for a while or if you've seen a pattern over the years but I believe that this has been an effect for the last three years right for the oil pumps. Oh i've been like here for just a year now so I don't know just about the past like yeah how's going but what are you like looking for you're looking for a residential area or what. Well it's possible that i'm wrong and this is a rather new thing that's meant to directly combat the carbon tax in a minor way and just completely go away with some of the oil defendants that we still have in the region of so lesser Ontario so it feels like that so i'm not sure. If there's if there's been a thing and it's like you know when you learn a new word and you hear everybody saying it like the next day or whatever it's like i never heard the oil pump or like the oil company that would people be getting heating from their homes from so i was just curious to know like what company that was because I know there was just amberging and gas. And they don't really do a oil. No don't they don't yeah or what do you have in your home do you have like gas for us or oil for us. I do have a gas for us so I don't believe I'd be eligible for or what it would be that you'd be offering or being a liais on for unfortunately but i'm just still curious because I might be able to facilitate some other people to get. Fave themselves some money. But you're in all of it you're not interested to get a heap on for your place no well i'm just wondering. Like what would you say to somebody it's like if there's no benefit or if there's no eligibility what what's the main benefit of a heat pump that let's say that there's no government incentive and nothing to expect there. Is there still a benefit to having a heat pump when i'm getting gas from like you know ember to union gas and then my. So how much do you pay for your gas per month so what I pay for my gas per month as I believe anywhere from like. It was anywhere from like 68 to like 89 dollars but then since the federal carbon tax which I believe is monthly i'm not 100% but it's a monthly amount that almost doubles. Oh monthly I thought annually. If it was annually then that makes a lot more sense because I I looked at it and it was like I believe it was a 79 or like 100 what wasn't in your familiarity like it was like almost like a hundred bucks or something like that right. I guess so I don't know to be honest but I can look at it but it's like I was scared because I felt like it was i'm going to be a monthly thing because it was you know kind of like I would expect an annual thing to be like 300 bucks or something like that. But you know how he comes work and anything about them or no. I do know that it that it like reciprocates like heat energy it's like a vacuum of n type of thing right. So I know like same type of technology is like what an air fryer would use but much less severe obviously. Yeah exactly. It's nothing like that. It's kind of like the same technology that a refrigerator uses basically but a refrigerator it has a refrigerator only so it does only cool in and a heat bomb it has a refrigerator and the compressor. So that's both eating and clean so big different. Yeah back no and then pump the air because there's humidity in the air so how the condenser but just not like free free on or maybe ask for your own or whatever. But I believe that the most efficient use of it is heating in the winter from what I understand rather than cooling. Yeah it would do it only cool by like sucking or whatever and then the model of condenser would be the thing that would determine how cool your home gets from what I understand. The coolant is almost kind of like similar as the AC's like almost the same year value just a bit higher like two points higher than that of normal AC's. Yeah like a higher CPU first where in ship like you know. If the same size as an 80 it would cool a little bit more in the same area. That's what you would be on. It uses a refrigerant. Yeah it uses refrigerant. Yeah. Are the campaigns for like selling these and setting these up are they like more prevalent for winter time or like summertime. It's actually is this an effective cooling agent. The thing is the reason why they were not actually use like any here for for a reason is because of the like winter like Canadian winters right. The heat pumps are used to like work only to like zero Celsius minus five Celsius outside. So people wouldn't like change to a heat pump like they wouldn't get it. But now they actually came up with the like cold climate for Canadian winter. It works till like minus 25 Celsius. So that's the key. It was possibly like a battery problem or an inverter problem. I don't know. For like keeping it going because I do remember that there's like a there's new batteries that have rolled out that makes a lot that made a lot of things that weren't so Canadian friendly. Canadian friendly like I have a lucky bike that he can it can charge and like you know half an hour for and ride for eight hours now because these new canium nitride batteries. And I believe that like if one of those has one of those in it, then I'm sold. But are they also like are they also using like solar panels or anything like that like the company that you're representing. Are they just we don't do. Yeah, we do like the heat pumps at a consolation water tank air seal and dox. Like that. Because the same technology in a water tank would make sense. Yeah, they call it like heat pump water tanks. So they use the same technology as a heat pump thermodynamics. Is this on the website like greener greener homes dot CA or anything like that like what would be the website for I could research some of the stuff. You want to search about it? Like if you have a brochure of models that that you commonly recommend or like sell, I feel like I could probably figure out whether or not it would be for me. And then I could. Because like honestly, where am I right now without too many government incentives. I wouldn't be an ideal customer. But I'm just interested in what the future of this type of thing looks like because people wouldn't spend all of this type of money and infrastructure and if they didn't believe in it or if they didn't think it was going to be a widely adopted thing and so western Ontario. It's kind of looking at what the thing would be if I was to build a tiny home somewhere heat pump would probably work great. I'm sure I can send you brochure. Yeah, I have your email second send you one. Okay, that'd be that'd be awesome. And it's um so it's a course at live dot com, I believe is if that's what you have. Yeah, yeah, of course, that was my was Daniel Howard at Gmail dot com, but course at live dot com is less letters to type so. Okay, all right, I'll just send it to you to the live dot com one. Okay, okay, that's some. All right, then thank you, Miles. Okay, and thank you. Your name again. My name is husband. Your name is husband. Well, well, thanks. I appreciate you all. I hope you have a lovely day. Yes, well, thank you. Bye bye now.

20240523-112755_2208_+14166977418_Outgoing_Auto_2197992584043.mp3," Hello. Hi, good morning. My name is Hikim Adil. Yes, hi, Miriam. Hi, Jaya. How are you today? I'm alright. You're wondering if I've decided yet on the unit, right? Yeah, I just wanted to touch face with you because we were, I believe we were supposed to touch face last week, but I don't think I was able, I tried to give you a show. Sorry. We've been, we've been having like a lot of information. Our house is not like really that standard. It's an open concept with high ceiling. Yeah. So, um, if we're getting mixed information, whether or not like what kind of unit we want to be load and this and that. So, we're still at 36,000 BTUs. But, um, the unit. We're trying to figure out what kind of unit we want, like whether or not we want to. The, uh, the hyper heat, like the. Um, that's really cool. Um, really cool climate one. Uh, because we're getting like base 14 anyway. So, we might go for one that's not. Oh, that. That cold. So that, you know, um. But I also want to know. So the one that you quoted, uh, that one's for cool climate, right? Yeah, yeah. And that's the like so the cold climate ones are the only ones that qualify and only actually specific brands and models. Uh, the government won't qualify like just like a made or lower efficiency one. Uh, they're pretty strict with those rules. The only thing I would say about that I'm like, I understand you guys are kind of deciding. The less efficient heat pumps are that they will only heat up efficiently in the winter time till about zero degrees. So what will happen is you guys will be using your baseboard heating a lot more than the heat pump. Um, and that's, you know, that's going to end up costing you guys like, uh, you know, much, much more. Um, yeah, that's why I'm inclined to go to the cold climate heat pump. So I'm in a little argument with my husband right now about it. Yeah, because the baseboard heating, uh, they say is just as I mean, I deal with a lot of clients that are on baseboard heating. And in the winter time, especially if you guys have cathedral ceilings, because there's a lot of heat loss of cathedral ceilings. The average, uh, a hydro bill for baseboard heating that I deal with is anywhere from depending on the size, uh, between 350 and 550 months. Um, so it's super, super high a baseboard heating is like super inefficient. It is, it's definitely good as an emergency backup, but as like a more of a primary heating source, you guys are going to spend a lot more money that way. So, okay, so I have your price here. I mean, I'm still considering, um, the good money, um, heat pump, cold climate heat pump. Yeah, it's been a very reputable brand and they're also approved from the government. If you guys did want to take advantage of the loan, uh, they are on the list of approval. Yeah. Okay. What was the square footage again? Um, it's a 25 by 30 foot, um, addition. And then the height of it is, um, like 26 feet. And then there's a, it's open concept, but there's also a top floor, right? A room or whatever? Um, that's why we need to unit so that it can, um, heat the top and the bottom. So if I look at this 15, you have a 12 and a 24 head, the sum or no? No, I would be, yeah, the largest header unit is the 18,000. Yeah. And then like, do you have, so all, okay, okay. So we have to do 18, 18, 18. Yeah, 18 and 18. Yeah, I would, I would suggest with the size and the, the biggest thing is because it's high ceiling or cathedral ceiling. Um, that's just naturally. It doesn't matter how efficient the home or unit is. It's, it's always going to lose a little bit more heat loss. Um, it's a nature of that kind of build. Um, so I would, based on the size and that, I would definitely go with the 36,000 BTU. Yeah, yeah. Pretty. We've definitely calculated that. Um, and it's definitely that's the one that we need. Yeah. Is it, is the bottom section like, is there, is it a lot more, um, living area, let's say, than the top or is it even? Um, yeah, a lot more living area because it's the kitchen in the, and just the living room. Right. Um, above is my work space. Because what I would maybe recommend another option is you go with the, um, the three head system. Wait, does that add up? Come on, let me just see. Yeah, so you can go with the three head system where there's two units on the bottom, since there's more living area. That way the heat and cooling disperses much better. If that makes sense. And then one large one in the top floor. Right, right. Um, it's up to you. I mean, there's the units are very powerful, but, and I know it's an open concept, but just as far as efficiency and like really kind of evenly distributing the heat. Essentially, I would, you know, I would say if there's room and space, uh, two units on the bottom and one on the top would be ideal. Yeah, it's the problem is it's the site that it would go on. There's like stairs, there's things in the way. Yeah. Um, so it just, we couldn't fit three on that side. I don't think with ease. I see. Yeah, like, yeah. Okay, no worries. I mean, if it's the good thing is it's open concept regardless. So, and these units are especially the 18,000. I mean, they're super powerful. So. And, um, good news was bought by. Yeah, so, yeah, so, sorry. Are they the same unit? I mean, Glenn are. I mean, yeah, they're pretty much the same like the same almost the same parts like it's pretty much, you know, the, the diken is more expensive, just because you're paying for the name. But as far as the, like the units itself, they're pretty much neck and neck. So, yeah, they're slim, right? They're not too. Yeah, yeah. Are they square? Uh, they're, they're square, but they're like, well, they're like not like kind of rectangular. Like, so they're more slim than square. It's not make sense. Yeah. Would you be able to give me the bottle number of it? Good then. Uh, I think I sent it. Um, it just says, uh, uh, should I send you the brochure? Let me see. Oh, maybe you did send it before. Yeah. So, uh, three. Oh, yeah. I think that brochure has all the options. Um, because they're pretty much the same. It's just whether you go with the three heads of some versus the two head kind of thing. Um, but I'm just looking at the brochure. So, there's the single zone. Sorry, I got it. 21 series. So, that's the, that's the, the make of it for the model. Uh, yeah, multi zone. And then. Right. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, so that has all the, and it has all the specs and all of that as well. Nice single zone, single wall, multi zone. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess, um, I mean, we're coming close to, to deciding. So, I'm sorry. It was taking so long, but, um, no, no worries. Um, is it, are you guys like still looking to take advantage of the incentive program? Or not necessarily not necessarily know. Okay, okay. Because that again, I mean, we, you could do the heat pump any time. I would say that would be the more time sensitive thing if you want to secure in your application, at least. Or want to maybe. Yeah, because at least that way, we can, even if we book the install like in a bit, at least, because it does take a bit of a process for the, for the incentive, the. And, um, that's why we wanted to get the application, etc, etc. Um, so at least that would secure it in. Do you want to maybe take the rest of the day to review the brochure and the option and then I can give you a show tomorrow if that works. Yeah, that would be good. Okay. And, uh, morning time, like around 10, 10 30s, okay, to give you a call. Yeah, 10 30 would be better. Okay, okay, sounds good. Do you know, I will give you a show. If you have any questions, you can always email me or you can give me a call, I'm usually in the office, until about seven o'clock. Otherwise, yeah, I'll give you a call tomorrow morning around 10 30 or so, and then, you know, we can take the next steps from there. Okay, thanks very much. All right, no problem, feel. Take care.

I'm inquiring as to when the rebase would be sent out. Is this the original door? Yes, it is. I'm just wondering. So you're asking when will the rebate check be delivered to your house? Yes, or sent in the mail, whatever. Right. I'm not exactly sure on that on the time frame for that. But what I do know is that put the three and two sodds have been approved for you. The energy advisor confirmed that your file was committed to the government and let's start a process from them. So I believe that the energy advisor would be the right person to ask that question. I think that would be a good thing. I believe that that is a good thing. I think that the government is not a good person to ask that question. And you should be a good person to ask the question. Because usually we either the government nor the government auditor. They do not share this kind of information with us because we are contractors. They can only share that information with the homeowner. So if you're the homeowner, I would recommend you contact them directly. I do what? your file and they could be the right people to give you an answer on the timeline of when you're going to get the check. Would you add in a note a phone number? No, sure, I can check that so you just give me a minute. Yeah. Okay, I have it here. Do you have a pen and paper? I do. Perfect. So the number is 416. 416. Okay. 9000. 9000. Okay. 4186. 4186. That's right. 4186. So I dialed one before the 416. Yes. That won't be necessary though. If you dial just the number that works as well. But if it's a solution, you can always dial one. Thank you. I got a question for you. Yes, please. Oh, can you be able to tell me the balance of what I owe or do I phone someone else? You can contact finance company that you have to loan with or I can actually look into the details if you just give me a minute. Sure. Thank you. Please give me a minute. I'll place the call on hold and I'll just get back to you. Okay. What was that? I'm just going to place the call on hold and I'll get back to you as soon as I have this information. Sure. Thank you. Okay. I'll have the amortization table here and front of me. And I see here that you've made five payments so far for $223.19 each. The last one was made on 14th May 2024. And after this payment, the total amount that is due is $26,471.49. The last payment was this month to 15th May 14th. Correct. Now, what was the balance? The balance is at $26,471.49. You say 26? Yes. 26? 27? 1.249. How did you get that? What I got it here in front of me is $222.520. $23,500. That was $23,370.4. Yeah, I could be wrong about that. Just give me one minute. Let me just double check that. I'll place the call on hold for a minute and I'll just get back to you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for being online, Mr. Rajanal. No problem. So yes, I was just going through the details and I also spoke to my manager and they told me that the table that I was actually looking at was the general table that was found at the time, the loan was tied. But the exact amount that you owe, finance it, the company would be able to tell you because if you've made certain payments already, so whatever is owing to you, would be that information only the finance company knows and be to not get records of your payments. So I can give you that number as well. What do you show? $25,500. Yes, it shows $23,370. But again, as I said, I cannot, this is a generic table of how the loan term should be but because this is an open loan and you can make payments more or less, it's not like it's a fixed payment. So whatever you paid so far and how much exactly do you owe, that information is with the finance company. Can you give me that number? Yes, absolutely. The number is 888. I'm sorry. 888. Okay, 888, 536. Okay, 3025. 3025. So I dialed one before the 888. Okay, and that's the finance company. That's correct, yes. And they'll be able to tell me what I owe and everything, right? Yes, because you're making the payments directly to them, the amount gets deducted by the finance company itself. So they have all the records how much has already been paid and how much do you owe? Yeah, and they would be able to tell me if I say one to the bank and put money in, they will tell me when they will be taken that out. Yes, absolutely. Everything. Everything about your loan, if you call this number, they can tell you everything. Well, I appreciate everything you've done for me. Thank you so much. All right, and you have a great day. You too, Mr. Dobin, have a good day. Thank you.

Oh, you have central air conditioner. Oh, I see. But no furnace. Electric furnace, but we don't use it because we have the boiler system. Oh, I see. Now, as long as the heat pump is concerned, for your place, it could be a ductless heat pump or ducted. So as you don't use your furnace, I believe you should be going with ductless then, because it's like mini splat that gets mounted to the wall. Right. Have you heard about that? Or no? I have not. No. Is this for furnaces? So like there are two types of them. What is ducted? For a ducted heat pump, it gets connected to the furnace, right? And the other is ductless. Duckless heat pumps, it gets mounted to the wall like mini splat. Yeah. So I was actually inquiring because of we were looking at updating our air conditioner. Okay. Sure. Not our heating system. Sure. Now, the heat pumps, it does like those coolant and heat em. So you can use it like for coolant and summer. And you can use it for heat and it went her. So it's up to you. The good thing is, as far as the heat and part of this concern, you will be saving about 80% of your gas bill when you use the heat pump for heat and the summer. Sorry, it went her. And you will be using it for coolant and summer as well, because it does two jobs. Okay. Yeah. So is this your primary residence? Yes. And you already homeowner cracked? Correct. What's the average monthly electricity and gas bill? It's a rough idea. Between the children who would be roughly about 300 bucks. Okay.

Ah, ahí, ahí, ahí, ahí. Ah, ahí, ahí, ahí, ahí. Mira, me mandaron. El correo que nos tenemos aquí es R-A-R-T-2002-0 a Jim O Dacop. ¿Qué es eso? Es eso, ¿no? Ahí. Sí. Aquí tengo una información, hago un confuo, ese es tuyo. A ver. ¿Cuál es tu correo electrónico? En miro debe decir Alexander.b a Weaver and Geek Home. No, no. Chequea les pama, a veces igual les pama a lo mejor. Aquí, está, aquí, está. Ahí a la vista. Ya. Ok, aquí lo tengo. Ok. Ahora. Mira, sí, mira. Mira, sí, mira, si es la alocción de Join Now.

No. Lo apreteo, ves de cómo dice ese púcer instalación y nada. ¿Pueden ir, Uey? Bueno, de la he ven, entonces, si no pude entrar, vamos a... Déjame... Vamos al... Me he meditado viendo la información y me dijeron que estaba buscando para un hip-hop. Para un hip-hop. ¿Y por qué no te he hip-hop? Eso es lo que te da la califación y la era condicionada, porque bien la nota que la era condicionada. ¿Nado se te rompió? ¿Era de condicionado, de la hija que tiene que compreter casa? Sí. Sí, el aire, el aire tenía un año y yo tengo 18 años de estar en esta casa. O sea, que estamos hablando que la gente tiene 19 años. Le dije a la hija que la que le formó la cambiarse entre años. Es nueva. Es hay eficiente. Sí. Eso es lo que le dije. Yo lo que le dije es que le he tenido una continuación para el aire condicionado. He ahí cocinado otra vez. Incluso lo tengo aprendido ahorita. Pero claro, a mí me gusta a UG y las cosas me tenés. Entonces, por este que me interesa los campios que hay y los beneficios que hay el gobierno también. Por ejemplo, te he cambiado las ventanas en casa y el gobierno me dio una buen reveille. Me pareció que la situación era parecida con el aire condicionado. El gobierno lo rive que yo dan no son de la era condicionado son para los hip-hams. Los hip-hams, por ejemplo, la función de hip-hump es lo mismo que el aire condicionado, pero no solamente te da aire frío o papelán, te da aire caliente para limpiarnos también. Y si todos tengan un high efficiency furnace, te cuesta menos con el hip-hump que con furnace. ¿Qué hago por la telefacción? Y todo caso. No, con la telefacción te quedas con la furnace. Hip-hump lo que va a hacer es que te lo va a dar, porque es más económico. Y por ejemplo, si hay poqué pueden funcionar hasta menos 30. Si hay algún día que vaya a poter bajo de menos 30, el sistema automáticamente se te cambia para la furnace. Ajá. Y así por ejemplo, las opciones que yo tengo son dos. El mirando. ¿Qué te escucho? ¿Se va a la comunicación? ¿Qué tamaño es esta mañana la casa? Mira, ¿me vivía? Yo lo que es eso, esto se llama un búngalo. Tiene 4 cuartos arriba y dos cuartos abajo. Es un búngalo y bueno la casa no es muy grande, ni tamaño pertenia, ni tamaño mediana. Yo creo que ese fue el problema cuando yo no pasé acá que el aire ha funcionado siempre igual. Me es un aire como el del que la cafe es mi hijo, que nosotros llegamos lo enciende y a los 10 minutos ya estamos todos frescos. Aquí tengo que parar alguna hora o dos horas para que me refresque la casa. Me plico. Sí, sí, sí. Entonces creo que la situación este aire no es lo suficiente, eficiente para la entra mañana casa. El problema de este día es que compré la casa. Pero como se los son tres meses, ya estamos hablando de Julio y Julio y Agosto, que es el tiempo que tal ver a ano, yo creo que hago es alimentarme como el aire y como el alico para que me refresque el aire la casa. Pero lo que también te puede hacer ya mejor un high-he piscín, así como tengo la califacción de la califacción de dos molasos me calientan la casa. Claro. Pero eso no lo tengo con el aire cogiserado. Bueno, cómo es la situación con ustedes? Por niñez es un aparato nuevo, ¿me imagino? Sí. Claro, porque yo tengo separado lo que es la ponesil y el aire cogicionado. Sí. Aunque ocupamos los mismos doctos y todo, pues uno es aire cogicionado y el alico de la califacción. Entonces, ¿te perne un aparato? Y ese aparato me sirve para las dos cosas, ¿no? Exactamente. Y el alico está conectado y va a estar conectado, el aparato va a estar conectado como el aire acondicionado a la furnace. Va a estar conectado el coil, va a estar por la furnace, se ve que a la furnace. O sea que está conectado a dockwork de tu casa. Sí, sí, me entiendo. Bueno, y eso es más o menos cuánto es el costo? El costo total viene siendo 585 o 85 con todo incluido la instalación, el EGPAMP, la guarantía. Te damos un mar Thermostat que deponemos la parepa que puedas controlar la temperatura. Todo incluido, al final, el precio es 585. 585,00, perfecticamente. 5,00,00. Sí, más o menos 5,00. ¿Y qué es lo que te da el gobierno? ¿Ustedes ya tienen la rebaja del gobierno? La rebaja del gobierno va a venir para junio. Que la verana de el gobierno, por ejemplo, va a ser, a lo mejor lo que te puedan ahorrar de eso, va a ser reotro en los mil dólares. ¿Por qué tú hiciste alguna prueba de energía ante o no? No, no. Me llamaron, me llamó. Este mira, el problema es que se llama mucha gente, todo lo que tú sabes como esto. Sí, sí. Yo era un terno localista a través de internet o a través del Facebook, pero la gente se te llamaba, aquí me llamó para esto, me llamó para lo otro. Y entonces, cuando les dije la gente te llamaba, me llamaba, que vamos a pasar por su casa, que te grati, yo no creo ni nada. Es esto, se me cosa que hay que hacer, y yo estoy muy ocupado, no lo puedo atender. Pero sí me he llamado, me he llamado, también para el LG, para la compañía de esta que yo estoy, tengo contratos con mí de Dios, y lo mismo, lo he dicho que no que. Que no me interesa. Déjame hacer una pregunta, ¿cuándo fue que tú hiciste la ventana? ¿Has recuanto fue que hiciste la ventana? La ventana, la ventana, el año pasado. ¿Y el año pasado cuando tú hiciste, tú tuviste que hacer pagar por alguna auditoría de energía o no? No. Yo, tú hiciste una conozca de Dios, yo me hicieron todo, me hicieron presopuestos, me hicieron las redas que vivieron las series para que ellos. Ah, ya. No sé qué habrán hecho yo, y cuánto fue la deba que consiguieron. Yo por ti hiciste un par de compañías que la que me salió más económica con esa mesa. No, claro, así es como debes la mentira en la pada. Bueno, vamos a hacer una cosa, Alex. Yo tengo en venta, yo sé lo que es esto. Pero yo, a día de junio lo tenemos a la vuelta en la esquina, pero sería que es lo que se puede conseguir antes de... Como tengo mi califación que está en la ventana y me trabaja las mil maravilla, pero yo no tengo problemas con la califación, porque incluso tengo hasta una garantía sentida que esté pagando a energía. ¿Ves? Ah, bueno. Y el aire acondicionado con esto también me está trabajando. O sea, que digo lo que quiere cambiar lo por algo que me he de mi carne en 20 minutos. Yo vengo a lo primero y me he de estar aquí como la califación, porque como te digo, el aire está pasado por el día de hoy. Claro, que a mí se entiende, lo que es que a mí se lo mantengo a 22. Pero como te digo, pues ya tiene casi 20 años ese año. Claro, que no sé, cupamos los 20 años y recupamos el mes de cada año, verás, lógicamente. Me lo veis, ya lo que hagas. También tengo con el aire y un servicio, si se me gobe el aire, pues también. O sea, yo estaba pensando que me voy a morraría todo esto, el servicio que esté pagando, porque yo pago por mantenimiento de el aire y por el mantenimiento del aire acondicionado. Eso me va a casi ochenta y con el rentado del tanque de agua, estés pagando 86 dólares mensuales. ¿Qué está pasando, renta, no? ¿Le aguantenimiento? De parte pagó de mantenimiento y de renta de tanque. Ya. Y fue un 86 dólares lo que pago al mes. Pero lo que le pasa es la califación. La verdad es que para hacer que honesto nunca lo he usado y ya tengo como 5 años en el teniente de esta garantía. Y nunca le he usado. Una vez en el rinúel termotato y me lo llero, me lo repararon y esto fue todo. Así es que porque se esperamos en todo segundo y a ver cuánto es lo que esto va a cortar. Y a ver qué podemos hacer. Yo lo que vamos a hacer es yo te vas a zapar el, reguá escribir aquí para cuando venga junio y ya tengamos todo en cuanto vamos a hacer esto. Yo tengo más información en concluso de cuánto va a ser exacto. Yo te llamo porque si los números dan la cuenta lo que podemos hacer es ya te podemos ya sacar un turno para junio para que sea el primero en la lista, para que no se te pase este ribay y lo puedas coger.

You have reached the city of vancouver. Your call is now on hold waiting for the next available agent. The event cover. My name is Pam. How may this be? Hi Pam, good afternoon. I called you earlier regarding the door to door sales. I'll door you company. OK, so sorry to call you again. I just forgot to ask about the interim one is the policy license. So I just got this information from small business that is possible to get an interim municipality license. So we're looking to do the activity for at least six municipalities in BC. This is something that you can also help me with. Yeah, the interim municipal business license is just to allow construction or trades related businesses. So your category that you will be doing, which is the door to door, does not apply to the IMBL in term municipal business license. It's strictly for plumbers actively doing plumbing work, builders, contractors, gas installation, gas appliance installation, those type of trades. Oh yes, so our product, we're not just going to do sales, but we will do installations as well. So this is product and services. So our products are mainly air conditioning, heat pumps, air handling. So we have technicians that they have a gas license. OK, so you're looking at two separate business license then, the one for the door to door and then the other one. So yes, you would be eligible for the intraminist to pull business license. How that works is you first get your city of Vancouver contractor business license issued. I'm sorry, thank you. You first get your business license. And then I'm just going to check to see if on the application you can indicate you want the interim municipal as well. One moment please. OK. OK. Yeah, it looks like you'll have to do the two applications, the business license, regular business license. OK. And then a separate IMBL. I am the, this IMBL for, is this any sort of service? Yeah, so that is for the installation of the HVAC and heat pumps. And it will work across all the municipalities, right? No. OK. So there are six cities that participate in this thing. So the six cities actually came up with a licensing agreement. And the six cities, it is listed on the site. But I'll just mention it to you. It will be the city of Bernabé. OK. Delta, New West, Richmond, New West, Richmond. Third. OK. And of course, including Vancouver. SUREY. Yeah, Vancouver. OK. Bernabé, how about this cookie time? No, it's a good one. Obstboard. No. Um, so for the lower mainland, those cities I mentioned, I guess you could say they immediately surround the city of Vancouver. Cucutlum is, they're not part of it now. No, it's for Cucutlum. OK. Or North Vancouver. Abbotsford is what we would classify in the Fraser Valley. I believe that they have something similar. OK. Oh, did they have something? Yeah, there's something called the Fraser Valley Intermunicipal Business License. And it's for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 cities out in the Fraser Valley. OK. OK. So those cities came up with their own agreement. OK. And then if you want to apply for this IML, is this the same as I'm on the register for an account? Is this the same page that they need to register? OK, the same. Just I need to register twice for the door and then for this IML. And do you know the time frame from the time I applied until the license is issued? Minimum six weeks. Minimum six weeks. Now that being said for the contract, the HVAC, and that type of license, if there is a project that you have did on them that you have received, and you need those license right away, you can after the fact just send an correspondence to the department, letting them know that there is a need to have the license issued a bit sooner. As they will do this for the trades contractors. Oh, OK. So there's an option to expedite it. Yes. OK. Both for the generic business license and IML, right? Yeah. So you need the generic one first before they'll issue the IML. But yeah, they will be within a time frame of each. Right. OK. So I need to wait for the Minimum six weeks. And after six weeks, I will be able to apply for IML. But say, for example, I apply for business license in Vancouver. And then obviously, I can also do the trade work, the installation work, because I have that license in Vancouver. This will cover the, is that correct? Sorry, that's a question. OK. So it will be step one. You get your city of Vancouver business license issued. Yeah. Step two, you will get your IML issued. And one step one is issue. You can start doing work in city of Vancouver. Including the installation or the guys installation works. OK. OK. And then step two will enable you to work on the six other cities. Now remember, step one, you are applying for two different licenses. One is the contractor one. And one is the door to door one. OK. So for the business license, what is that contractor again? So I missed that door to door. And yeah, it's just a bit licenses. You will have to get one is for the actual installation of your product. So I'm looking for three licenses. Yeah. Now you're at three. Yeah. Right. OK. So business license, daughter door, second license in Vancouver, just the contractor. And then in or more that I am billed right after the IML. OK. So I need to get first the business license done after the, sorry, before I apply for the contractor one, right? Yeah, the IML one. No, what I mean, sorry, within, within Vancouver. Within Vancouver, yes. Yeah, yeah. OK. So I need to wait for my business license generic one before I apply for the contractor license. And I mean, once again, when you are applying through the portal, you want to make a note to the effect that I am also going to be applying for an IML so that whichever clerk is assigned to your application can hopefully do them side by side. Even though it's two separate applications, you have to put through. All right. OK. Right. OK. I'm officially asking. And vice versa. Like if somebody sees your IML first before they see your other one, they'll see your notes saying, I am also applying for my regular business license application at the same time. OK. So that IML will cover both the door to door and the contractor license. It will not. It will not. Your door to door is a total separate thing by itself. I mean, you could be selling oranges and your HVAC. But at the same time, but you will still need like a peddler license. It's not related to your contractor business at all. OK. It's like you got two business on the go. One is you're doing contracting work and the second is you're doing door to door. OK. Right. OK. Because the IML is only for trade, which is, you know, the gas installation. So that means I would need to get another separate license from each municipal before the door to door sales. Right. Exactly. Yep. Too much work. But I know. OK. Pa, would you go in to take down your name? So Brawler is going to look for you whenever I have questions for you. OK. My suggestion to help you is that each municipality, you might want to get a map out. And the lower mainline has their own website and contact. So instead of you having to call them all out, you might just want to do like, you know, send out an email to them. Or on their website, just search the word door to door sales or peddler or contractor license. OK. Peddler. Door to door sales. OK. Perfect. Yeah. All right, Pa. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye. Our phones work in a very, very good way in that if I've spoken to you, it'll reroute the call to me. But if I'm on the phone, it'll go to someone else. Oh. And if that's why you called me now because you called me earlier and I spoke to you. So the system knows that you spoke to me. So the call comes through to me. But if I'm on a call or I'm not here, it'll go to someone else. OK. All right. That's fine. I'll look for you. I'll look for you. I know I know I know that's fine. OK. Thank you for that information.

Yes, I am, but it's my constrict right now, but I didn't make a request for you guys to send me a copy of the invoice confirming that I will copy up to receipt that I did complete the PMA because I need this for my energy audit. Can you write it down that over here? Yes, I understand that, but it is just the quality installation call. It takes only a minute or so. I am unable to even hold on. You are going to have to put it up if someone can speak before you continue this, right? So, I can't speak right now. If you guys can call me back in like 45 minutes, I should be good.

The reason for the call buzz, we were supposed to have a meeting at 6 o'clock. I just wanted to give you a friendly reminder. Oh, it's Google Meet call, right? Yes, it is. Yes, it is. Okay. I'm at work at 6. But I'll just log on to Google at that point, I guess. Can we make it on 7, actually? Usually we're done as 7. If we do 7, will you be able to make it 100%. I just want to make sure that if I'm staying behind both, because usually we wrap it up as 7, but honestly for you. Yeah, I know, I think that's 7 o'clock. 7 o'clock for sure, even like 6 o'clock log on, but like, I'm at a retail store, right? Sure. So, I'm at a, I work at a retail store. Okay. So, just in case a customer walks in, we might be interrupted, but I think that's 7, I should be free, basically. Perfect, yeah. What we could do is, which one works best for you, then 7 should be good? 7 works good. Okay. See you on 7. Right. So, 7 o'clock, I'll just log on to Google for sure. Sounds good. Sounds good. And I think you sent me the invite yesterday. You did, right? My colleague did. My colleague had booked our appointments. She did, yes. No problem. And we're discussing what the heat pump? Yes, I believe I said on the notes that you already got to approve for the loan. You were just pretty much gathering pricing and kind of like how long it was going to take, because you already did the outer, right? I did the pre-energy audit, right? Okay. And I got solar panels installed, right? Okay. So, I am getting that $5,000 rebate, but my energy auditor told me that because I did the pre-energy audit, so I qualified for the additional rebate as well. And because there was some new infusion of funds by the government. So, he said, like, why don't you look into getting a heat pump as well while you're at it? So, I said, why not? So, you're going to get a now, we're going to look at, keep bumping stall, and then, okay, yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Yeah. So, I just want to see whether it's worth it, right? Because my air conditioner is just $7,000, right? The unit at my house is just $7,000, and I need a bigger unit too, right? Because it's a $4,000 square foot house with a finished basement. So, I guess I need a $4.5 down. I'm talking to you because right now there's no customers, right? This is not the customer that I... Yeah, yeah, not the customer. By the way, if I hear you've got it, I know that was because of a customer came. Okay, what I can do is I can do for the 5, like 4 to 5 down anyways. So, I'm going to give you a question on that. Because yeah, your house, I think, is about $4,000 square foot, right? It is. That's pretty good. That's pretty good. All right, and what about the air conditioner? So, the air conditioner essentially goes wasted after? Yeah, so, for the air conditioner, you can do two things. Because it's fairly new, you might... If you want to sell it, you could sell it on your own. If you want to dispose it, we could help you dispose it for you. But I'm pretty sure maybe you want to look into selling it, right? Okay, so basically essentially putting it in the market place or something like that, right? Exactly, yeah. And then somebody would come to my house and pick up the air conditioner from me. Would you be able to help me in that process though? For what we would do is we would uninstall it. And we can offer you the option of disposing it. But we don't handle anything in terms of selling it or anything like that, no. But if I'm selling it, like you went you uninstall it, then the person just has to come and pick it up, right? Yes. Or do they have to do anything else? No, they just have to come and pick it up. I think that would be pretty straightforward. And when we are talking about Chinese brands or are we talking about green or something from North America? The whole from the wolf that we have, the wolf from North America is BladeX, which was actually funded in Marcom. It's been three owned business for three years. They have done pretty well in terms of national in Canada. They have a little bit more climate, so they will go down to minus 30. The other one that we have is a little bit more premium, which is a little bit more expensive. The main difference between the two, to be honest with you, is one is just more known international and has a lot longer in the game. But the wolf is going to be the second one is going to be green or toss it. Green is the Chinese brand, right? In green media, they are both the biggest manufacturers and they are both Chinese. Okay. And they do have some five tons that qualify for the repaid, because I was told that they don't have five tons that took a qualify for the repaid, or like four and a half tons. We can do either four or four and a half. And they both qualify for the repaid, right? Yes, all of our brands and models that do qualify for the repaid, yes. So you're saying Bladex is the local one. Let me do some research on Bladex and Green. I know Green is a good brand, but it's a Chinese brand, right? So that's, and then what about the compatibility with my fullness? It shouldn't be an issue. As long as you probably have a fairer, like bigger furnace, how many BTUs is your furnace? I think my furnace is not big as well. What I looked at was it's around 60,000 or 80,000, whereas it should be around 120,000. Got it, because one thing that I can do say though is that my technicians would always do an assessment. And if they go over, for example, and they feel like the size of the heap on the few big for the furnace, the most likely the chance of them not installing it is going to be very big. So, because you said your furnace is 80,000 BTU? I think it is. I can check it out. I don't remember it now, but I think it's around that. Sounds good. How do you calculate the BTU? There is some way to calculate this, right? Or is it on the panel inside? It's written over there. It should be in the furnace, yeah. Yeah, so maybe when we talk, like we can, you know, I can go check that as well, but I think it's less than 100,000 for sure, because I wanted a 100,000 one. But it's installed by the builder, right? It's seven years old. And it can be 60,000. So it has to be an 80,000. Yeah, it should be bigger than 60,000. Yeah, so I guess it's around that. But how do you qualify that? Like whether it's going to be compatible with the heap pump and all the stuff? It's going to be depending on the sizing of the pretty much the coil. Right. And when would you be making those assessments, basically? Because I need to know of it because June 7th is when I have scheduled the post assessment, the post energy audit, actually. Okay. Right. So we can do that. Assessment and installation here. Let me double check your address where it was at Brampton. Okay. You're very close to us. You know, if everything looks good on paper and we get agreement and the deposit down, what we would do is we would say we continue somebody over as soon as possible. How much am I looking at? Here, let me take a look. The five ton, you're looking at, so R3. The two options that we have is three and a half and four or four and a half. You're looking at after taxes, 70, A53. And that's which model? That's for the Bladex. Okay. And the agree? The agree after taxes is going to be about 11,017. So it's about roughly $4,000 more. So we're going to have $3,000 in a little bit. Let's talk about it. And I'll talk to you at seven then. In the meantime, I'm going to look at Bladex and see what they are. All right. Thank you then.

Good, good, good. Thank you, how are you? Good, good. Yesterday, one of your associates told me about the feed pump or anything. It's a free feed pump or something. I know it's not a feed antenna. Would you claim me like a bus to a procedure for the feed pump or is butter pump too? Sure. So, as far as the heat pumps are concerned, there are programs from the government. So, before there was a rebate program running from the government that was a rebate of up to $7,000 for the heat pump. Obviously, like you said, nothing is for free, but it's the marketing. How it's free, actually, so, but this rebate program for $7,000 that ended on 5th of January. What rebate? Your January, if I'm not wrong. Yeah. So, right now, there is another 0% interest program that's running. And in addition to that, it really depends on what your system is right now. And your bills and your annual income. So, if you're making, to be honest, if you're making a lot of money, then you wouldn't qualify for the programs. But if you're not making a lot of money, and in addition to that, your bills are high. If you are paying, let's say, $50 for hydro and $70 for gas a month, then it wouldn't make any difference. But let's say if your utility bills are anything between $200 to $250, maybe $300 a month, then it would definitely make a big difference. And it would help you with a savings program on your bills as well as there is a bills rebate from the government that's running as a moment as well. And in addition to that, the heat pump itself, it's up to $7,000 more energy efficient than conventional furnace and AC. So, our advisor would do the math obviously, they're the experts. I'm only the call center agent. They do the math and the calculation for you and show you how it works and how it is. And obviously from there on, it's up to you. If you like it, if you think that it's something for you, you can go ahead with it. If you don't like it, you don't like it. No obligations attached. Yeah. But there is no rebate anymore, right? The rebate itself is not there anymore, correct? Yeah. There is another program from the government, which is zero percent interest. And another program which helps with utility bills. So these are the two programs that government introduced after the end of the rebate. Yeah. Yeah. I understand the help with the utility, which I mean, of course, if you're having the higher efficiency water pump, you already usually tell the world, they come down right, but the government not putting anything else, right? No, there is a bill rebate. So that is their as well. When it's high efficiency, you will be, I mean, your bills will go down. That's their as well. But in addition to that, if you're moving from less efficient equipment to energy efficient equipment, there is a build rebate. So let's say if your bill is $100 a month, I think the rebate is up to 30 percent. It depends on homeowners. Most of the homeowners qualify for between 20 to 25 percent. And what actually happens is there is an income condition to raise. Absolutely. I have to be, I have to be go through that program. So here I can start those program. Then I really call you back. So you mean that you want to look at up, correct? So you can, so you can Google look it up. The government zero percent loan program for heat pumps. That's zero percent loan program from the government that you can look into. There are many programs as such from the government, but this one is. Poreclery for heat pumps. And it requires an audit as well and energy audit, which you do. But then the government pays you back. So you do the energy audit for I don't know, $7800. And then the government pays you back that $7800 right away. So I go through the audit. So with that, and you can also look up build rebates on tarry or utility build rebates. And you can look into the details, the income detail and everything and find out if you can actually qualify or not. And if you need our help, you can give us a call and I can or wherever you get connected to will. Book you for an appointment with one of our advisors to help you assist. So I will definitely do that one first. Let me find out the details and everything. Action for the program. I respect you are honesty and do try to tell me what is what's going on. I have like little with awareness going on because I knew what I was just want to be installed heat pump before. And we ate it, but it's too late now. I couldn't right that time. It was truly free. So you would install it for $7800 and then the government would pay you back that amount. I know I understand that program. I couldn't fix also. I am late now. I just go through this one. Maybe such kind of evening coming back and no idea yet. Right. You never know with the government. Absolutely. It may come back. It may not come back. We hope that it comes back to the poor and poor homeowners have the opportunity again. But yeah, fingers crossed. Thank you very much. I have you. I have you. I have you address and all kinds of. So in case I make mine to do that one I call you back. Absolutely. Thank you so much. Have a good day.

If I can save, if I can get you guys can save me like 3%, I can do a check. I don't know. Yeah. Or is that the last part best pressure got? If I put it on the credit card, you're going to get a charge 3%. Yeah, so if you could not check now, we'll be if you can do a check, that's that's appreciated. Yeah. That's better.

The reason for the call is we got an inquiry through Facebook about a heat pump. Oh, is it a heat pump? I'm sorry, I was inquiring about air conditioning in my house. Yes, so heat pump is kind of like an air conditioner and a heating as well. Because were you looking for like an AC for the home? Just AC, yes. Because what do you have for the winter? Do you have a furnace? Yeah, we do. How old is your furnace? It's pretty new, actually. They got it last year. Oh, that's pretty good, which means that is probably high efficiency, right? Let me ask you one thing, because I don't mind if it's usually for heat pumps, we do meetings, but for AC, I can just tell you the price pretty much like upfront. How big is your home? It's two floors and it's attached to another house. Okay. Yeah, like it has a basement and like the three bedrooms are upstairs and then yeah. Do you know, size wise, like square footage? Roughly, doesn't have to be exact, but roughly. I have no idea to be honest. That's okay, that's okay. Are you Spanish by any chance? Yeah. Where? In Ecuador. Ecuador, much better. I know, I know. Oh, I'm sorry. So what happened to AC? Did you break your feet or not? No, the plan was never that I think that house, we were there in June of the year. And it wasn't that well-conditioned. And what kind of furnace are the ones that were supposed to be? Was it an electric or was it an gas? Electric, I think, it doesn't have gas. It doesn't have gas? Yes. And then your house, your house has the dockwork. What is that? That's the most well-known thing. The panels, that the air in the house, are distributed by the... By the way, what's your thing? Yes, yes, there are like a few squares, so there's a lot of heat in there, right? And we're going to have a little bit of an idea if it's at price, we know it's worth it, because I would have to look for a price at the cost of size, right? But how much more or less, where are you going to start to see how far they are? Are they around or what if they are? We're in Berries. In Berries. Let me see how far you are. Do you have the direction there more or less to go to the house? Yes, the house is 63. How's that? It's like C-H-A-U-C-E-R-E-Crescent. Crescent? In Berries. Yes. Let me see how far you are from us. And maybe you can see that you are the size of the house. I can see that you are the size of the house. You were 63, right? Yes. Let me check it out here quickly. How long have you been there? In July. In July. In July. In July, in July, in a year or so. How do you like Berries? Yes, I like Berries. Very good. The bad thing about the online site that they tell you at the house is that if you don't want to create a account, you can send all the information. So I'm looking for a way to... Even if it's 10 years old. More or less. More or less. Yes. Or is it the first time you start to find it or have you seen another price for the air conditioning? It's the first time. It's the first person that calls me. Now I'm going to send you some information to see how it works. It has an idea, right? Of course. And who in the house do you think you know about this size of the house? The same thing is not exactly the same. I don't know if you're also seeing someone. But I can have a chat with you. But now we're not there. Don't worry. That's the third one. Yes. Here it says that the size of the house is getting lower than this one. I think that's the same. I don't have an idea. To make it a bit sincere. No, don't worry. Well, let's do something. Because I have your number. What do you think? You pay it from the front and you have to go to the back. Yes. I don't know if you can tell how it works. It depends on how it works. And what's the other thing? The other thing is the example of the LIC. You can also check the HIPAM. Because HIPAM is what gives it the environment. But give me the price of LIC. And pay it to be one at a time and a half. You don't have to do that much. Okay. Tell me. Tell me. Yes, because it's not that big. Yes, with that size it's more than enough. I'll see you here. The price is here. And now I have a lot of money. And I send you the mail. Okay, thanks.

Small business BC, please allow me help you. Hi, I'm Graff to know. I'm Amy Magina and I'm calling from Ontario. I spoke with Gary yesterday. Is there any way that I can speak with him again today? He's out of the office at an event today but he'll be back into the office tomorrow. Is there anything that can help you? Oh yeah, of course. So we are an Ontario based company and we are looking to expand in BC. Gary just gave me kind of overview and advice with regards to where to go, which organization to ask and then he asked me to go to CDVancouver and I want to go back to him to ask for good questions. So I know you can help you also. So we are an HIV company and would like to do a doctor go sales and I got the business license information from CDVancouver and then I just want to ask you if you could just tell me what else do I need to look at for me to be able to set this company up in Vancouver. I mean I'm not entirely sure what all the information that Gary did give you but how is the business registered in Ontario? Okay so we have an extra provincial extra provincial license in BC. Okay so you are registering BC then? Yes. Okay and then since you wanted to do the rec sales, another license, a business license needs to be applied in whatever CDVancouver wanted to do the work and I just want to ask you know what else do I need to know? Say the you know tax impacts, the bonding requirements or I'm not sure if you advise this kind of stuff if we're setting up a job. Yeah not on the tax side of things. Like I mean we can give you general information with regards to like GST and PST. But if you're talking more like on the accounting side of things for the business that would be something you'd have to talk to an accountant about. Okay okay no worries. There's a few other questions that you have there. Yeah. Okay so removing the accounting side that taxes each other is right. Anything that would you like to share? I'm sorry I just got there all the information before we really launch over there so I know the overall view of everything. Let me send you I mean we do have a checklist of basically go requirements for starting a corporation here in BC. So a lot of those records would still be the would be the same even though you've got like an extra provincial company because it is still treated as a as a corporation but I can send you that so that would give you sort of like the basics. I mean I think for the most part you've got everything covered the only missing pieces would essentially be whether you're required to register with works at BC for workers compensation. Oh sorry it's WSIB here it's WXFGBC. Yeah okay. Okay. Okay yeah and I yeah sorry for that. Yeah. Okay. No I don't I totally get it. Gary and I have been here for so long we still refer to it as the old term because that's what we did for over many years. So yeah so workers compensation and then insurance would essentially be the only other thing that I can think of. Insurance for like for the company. Yeah. Okay. If we think of because we are selling HVAC and most here and are we we subcontract it you know and then that subcontractor who wanted to reassign him to BC but he's not on our payroll but he is a subcontractor. What will make the difference? You could always request because he is a subcontractor. You could always request that they have their own workers compensation their own insurance and things like that for for themselves right? Right okay. I will call it employment for like a better term but I was part of their contract right? Yeah. Now let me I'm still going to send that information to you though just so you have it. Sorry give me a sec here. Oh this one. I think generally speaking I think you should be pretty good because you do have sort of everything that you need. Now in terms of the sales of the actual products or anything like that that would be for sure you'd need to get in contact with the provincial sales tax office to find out about what essentially would be taxable for any of the any of the products and I'll find for that PST number. GST typically I mean if you already have a GST number you would you would essentially use the same thing if the products are being built under your company and not the contractor. Like if he's not doing like individual billing if he's or invoicing like if he invoicing on behalf of the the company and it's going through you then you would use your company's tax number. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. How about your email? Oh sure it's I'll spell it out for you. G as in golf. I India and November A alpha L Nema Yanki and November dot R as in Romeo and we weaver weaver as in weaving it's W E A We V E R and then E CO and then H O M E dot com. Let me repeat that back to you just make sure I've got everything correctly here so that's Gina so GI and then Lynn L Y N dot R at W E A V E R E CO H O M E dot com. That is correct. Okay sorry you were going to ask a question. Yes. Sorry I forgot my question but yes I was just another way. So the technician is done. How about the bonding requirements? I think I've heard from Gary the bonding requirements. Do they need to ask us from you? I can just find this out from the prevent the the money municipalities. So bonding for the like are we talking like bonding insurance or Yes, thanks for bonding insurance. Yeah I don't really understand this but he just mentioned this if we need this requirement. I don't have any idea. Yeah so sometimes you would want to get like bonding insurance for the person especially if they're entering for them. Bullock residential homes and things like that just to just to offer like an additional level of security. Protection and stuff like that. I don't know that it's necessarily required but let me just see here. And he's just doing sales right not actual installation. Where's he doing installation? Oh yeah we will be providing sales product services. So literally the people that will be hiring it's either salesperson and technicians. Yeah technician can be a subcontractor. Salesperson can be you know someone we hired. Yeah. Yeah it just sounds like that's all just insurance. You could get in contact with they're called a surety bonds and you can actually get in contact with technical safety BC and they should be able to give you some some information. I don't know because I know there is some specific for a gas and electrical contractors. I'm not sure if there's any other specifically for HVAC. So you can give them a call. I believe that's maybe what Gary was talking about. So you can just give technical safety BC a call and then they should be able to to answer that for you. Okay right and if it's not needed in applying for business license I mean the primary requirements then I'll leave it later on. But yeah I'll take that in mind. Okay Pandan I'll give you the I can give you the phone number if you want. Oh yeah please. Yeah technical safety BC. And then the phone over there is 1866. 566. Okay 7233. Okay so this is technical safety BC. All right. Yeah and just to find out if you know for for HVAC contractors if they require a bond and then they should be able to answer that for you. All right and doing you go physical lodgers or whether we have an adress but like physical adress. You know well you've got if you've got it registered extra preventially right what adress did you use there was that like a lawyer or I can't remember. So we have yeah the head office adress is our Ontario address. And then there's a name of a tourney the corporation or firm name and then there's a mailing address. And yes that's in the that's the BC address. Yeah that's all you need. Okay um you mean indeed. But you are you are going to need some type of adress for the license right. Okay. For for the city. So yeah we have an adress I think the reason being we use the corporation or firm name there's an agency applied on our behalf is because for the physical males they will be receiving the males and they'll defend this males to us in Ontario. I think that's a virtual office kind of thing. A virtual office yes that's correct. Yeah yeah and that should be yeah that should be the usually the adress that you would want to use is whatever you're using for BC as your adress. I see um okay I think yeah you will be sending the basic yeah the basic requirements. Yeah I'm going to send that to you now I was just waiting just to be sure that there was nothing else to send you so I'm going to send that to you now. Yeah that is correct and I want to it's just difficult if you miss something and something is dependent on that requirement and everything it's just frozen you know what I mean. SBB checklist okay. I mean it is just basic information but I think I think it pretty well covered there's just a couple of things to just maybe look into um especially on the on the taxation side of it just to have a quick look there is some information there with both GST and provincial self-tax on the on the checklist and then workers compensation whether it's whether it's a requirement. I've been trying to think it is because you are a corporation. Yes. All right. What's the difference between the um provincial license and then the business license? So um the background of my question is we were under impression that provincial license is already sufficient for us to carry out work in BC and now we were just surprised that every municipality has its own rules and regulations and we need to apply for different if you have like seven or eight municipalities that good that means if have different um rules that means it licenses potentially. So yeah. Yeah so with the with construction and trades they do have what's called an inter municipal business license so you can apply you apply for your license in one municipality and if you're going to be doing work in say six different municipalities kind of thing you can apply for that that inter municipal which allows you to work in multiple city but only still having one license. Yeah so I think this is a good inter municipality license and where should I apply for this one? Um so if you're if you're doing the city of Vancouver you can apply for that for it there at the same time so it's essentially an additional $250 and it'll cover six different municipalities in the metro Vancouver area. Oh $250 okay yeah okay um okay I think this is better right? And you can and you can let them know I mean you still have to apply for the for the main license um but then for an additional 250 I think they they include the inter municipal so you can ask them when you're when you're doing that application um how to how to to get that inter municipal business license as well. Okay so can I can I ask this question to um city of Vancouver? Yes yep oh yeah so the one's that issue it? Yeah I see okay I know things are done a little bit different here differently here in BC so your provincial registration just essentially gives you that permission to be able to operate the business in BC right where it offers like the name protections that's like that allows you to open bank accounts and all of that kind of stuff but where it differs from Ontario where Ontario you have a master business license BC uh each municipality manages their own um zoning and bylaw regulations. So it's just in our license to operate up and up a book bank account and there's there are limitations. Well the bank account is based on the the provincial registration so not the municipal the municipal specifically for the actual work being done right so it's like an operating permit. I see it's a little bit different. All right okay um yeah is there anything else I can I need to know just before I end this call? I think that's about it. That's about it okay yeah um thank you so much for your name again it's Amy. Amy okay thank you so much Amy for your help. Yeah no problem. All right bye bye have a good day.

That's a great question. The reason for the reach out is because we do have a team that goes over everything in terms of pricing, installation, all of that. Because when you put the ad, how much do you currently have an AC and a furnace or you don't have an AC? Oh, yeah, I have a furnace and just units. Like I have a boiler system, so I'm just wondering if you have duck lists as well. Yeah, we do provide doc list. We do provide doctor doc list. What type of how many heads were you thinking?

Why? Why do you want to know? Size of the home, give us a better idea of the right sizing for you. Okay. No, it's fine. Different apartments have different units. Okay. So it's not like we need to figure out anything like that. There's four apartments in the house. Gotcha. So what we could do is I can't double take a look at here on my guide schedule.

Where if I got to do have it, the right address and the right email in on file? Yeah. Okay. Good. Can you email me your information?

So I can give you specifics as to what instead of wasting somebody's time to everybody's time to come out here and do the quote and all that stuff. And I can give you like unit names and everything and kind of describe the situation for you in an email. And then maybe you can get back to me with like a rough quote. Yeah, we could do that because instead of sending somebody over the way that we do it here is that we actually do it virtually. So it's online. Oh, okay. Like you mean like a Zoom call or something? Exactly. Yes. Oh, okay. The main thing about the Zoom call is just that it gives you an idea of like the company. You get to see what's included in the packages in terms of warranties. It gives you a better breakdown of everything and a couple of options when it comes to the financing part because I know you're probably, you do have the option of always pay it upfront, but we do also work with like a financial company that if that's an option that you want to consider. They're going to be able to be more specific. Let me send you a link for because how's your schedule throughout the week between tomorrow and Friday? No, you know what? Possibly on the weekend, possibly Friday or Saturday. I'm not sure. Pretty busy this week. And then I'm going out of town Tuesday. So we would have to be looking for about a week and out of town. I don't know. Let me ask my business partner as well because I have to find out his schedule. And then we'll just go from there.

Thank you for the call because I was actually about to call you. I was just been back to back with meetings. I got it from them and it's still the same. So as long as you don't have a co-signer, they didn't get accepted unfortunately. What did message that the pop club decided to reduce the price? Sorry. If I can reduce the message that pop club later, when I was a, the second one that I did, one of the messages they said was that if I can reduce the amount by 3500. So I was thinking that can we remove the water pump? Let me take a look. I have it right here. I didn't. Yeah, they put that it's a co-signer or a candidate that should reduce the amount by 3500. So I'm thinking if we remove the water pump, the heat pump would be. I don't want to try that one. I'm not going to have one then. Fine. Let them go. Here it says that the loan amount, they can only approve up to 3000. That's what it said. They can only approve up to 3000. Yeah. Which is very low. It's very little. No, that wasn't what I got yesterday. I'm just looking at it here. Okay. If you want to check on your end, double check it too. This is the one that I'm looking at here. Let me see. It's true. It's true. So I'm sure. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll give you one. Wait, let me do something here. Oh, no. I was too 40 or can I never mind. Okay. Yeah. So I will put this down. They said they choose the low up for shoes amount. We use the pushes amount. So oh, I'm going to buy to 3000 500. No. Yeah, that doesn't cover really anything. That's the problem with that. You know. Does anyone back in front of make this work? Is just that for some reason it didn't get. They just didn't get it approved. That is fine. No problem.

Now, we'll get time to speak. Yeah, just give me like two minutes to gather what I'm doing up and go to another room. Okay. Okay, let me, you want me to call you back in about two to three minutes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm here. Okay. Perfect. So let me just pull up your email here again. And I know that you were, uh, oh, you were looking for the three template acts. Okay. And then you want to tell about the, um, the filter, right? Yes. Um, let me get to my, um, message to you. Oh. Yes. Yes. About the half of filters and the, uh, what is it called? The room sensors? Yes. And then there was the warranty, I believe, as well. Yeah. Yeah. There was a couple of other things, but I don't have. So let me just get to it. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. So I'm, I'm, I'm, I think it's not just a half of filter. Is it? It's some sort of unit that fits into it? Or is it just, uh, slide in, have the filter? No, no, no, it's a, it's a unit. Uh, well, it's up to you with there's two different types. Uh, we can do. There is one, uh, like, full unit that fits in with a UV light system as well. Uh, that's going to be more expensive. And then there's the regular, uh, filter system. But it is kind of like a, you know, that fits in the duck work, right? For the full, for the, uh, into the, the duck work, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's the one you have to like, I won't need. You don't need. Okay. Uh, so I can, what does, uh, I guess my first question to you, uh, Brenda, were you okay with paying up front? And then waiting for the, okay, because then I can, uh, I can work out a, a little bit of an extra discount. So if we're making up the, you said that to me. So, yeah, I had that in my plant. Okay. Hey, anymore, you can get a discount. Why not? Um, and then I know you can from 2700. That's also including the basement, right? Yeah. So, 3,000, I think it does. Yeah. 3,000, let's put this aside. For that size and it's fairly spread out between the two floors. So, okay, let's see what we can do. So, the 3,000, the, uh, 62, 15, all in. The warranty, uh, we are doing, so the, the warranty on its own, because by the way, we pay us five times. We're doing, so the warranty on its own, because by the way, we pay a separate insurance on it. We provide you with that insurance number, so the valid warranty. And if you're looking for the 10, you know, 10 year full protection, they call it. So you're covered on everything for 10 years. So, as they actually charge separately, I believe they charge, um, 1600. We are doing a discount or promotion, uh, for the month of May for at 960. So I'm giving that to you at a good. You're quite a bit more than the other company, the other company said. Because they included it right from the beginning. And if I didn't want it, they take off 500. Okay, but it depends on what they're, what insurance company they're going with. Or if it is with an insurance company, because what happens, and this is why we're a little bit more expensive with the warranty. A lot of companies just offer the warranty, but it's just basically word of mouth from their company. The, when you have a warranty through an insurance, that means let's say, I mean, knock on wood, it's not going to happen anytime soon. Say we were to go to business or anything like that. We actually assign you an insurance number that you always have access to that. Weren't you, even if let's say we wanted a business or disappeared? Right? So, okay, how long has it been in business? Oh, we've been in business for 18 years and we're, we're not in a license and yeah. Yeah, we're licensed in Ontario, we're licensed in Alberta, we're licensed in BC. So, we're not going out of business anytime soon, but you know, we were, you know, we're not just looking to just, you know, squeeze out. We believe, I mean, a heat pump is a long-term investment in your home. Yeah, exactly. So, warranty is super, you know, super important. So, anyway, I can give it to you for for 960. That is a discounted rates through the insurance. And we're going to give you the insurance number. And then the filter, the filter. So, again, it's a full filter system. Let me see what I can do because now we're doing the second product. So, the regular price width. So, I'm going to, so the regular price of the half a filter. And then if I include the centers as well. The centers are, I believe you're about 150 like market price. Like that's how they about 150 each. And then the half a filter is about, I believe it's about 1700. Let me see what I can do. Okay, I'll tell you what. Since you're including another service now or product. I can give you the combination of the half a filter with the two centers. Okay, so that connects to the smart thermostat. And give you a discount if you go with the full warranty and the heat pump system, of course. So, I can bring it down to 1200, which is basically taking $500 off. Okay, so that would be 1200 for the sensors and the half a filter system. Yeah. So, all in if you want the full warranty. So, what was it, the full tenure protection plan at the 960 and then the full half a filter system and the two centers. Okay, so, so that's all for the full warranty. So, the full warranty protection plan is all together with the heat pump, of course, and installation and all. 8410 plus HSD, fallen. So, that means like, you like to meet 8% before. It depends if you're paying, it depends if you're paying by cash or credit card. So, if you had cash, I can do, do you know if you're going to do cash or credit card? Well, if I get a cash use check or whatever, whatever you call them. So, it's the same as cash, but I don't have to carry. Yeah, yeah, of course. So, when I say cash, we mean certified check. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so I can give you the, if I told you 8%, then that I'll give you the 8%. Okay, so, and you've given me the, the 310 furnace at 5950, right? The 310 heat pump system, right? You mean? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's what I meant. So, the 310 ugly, this is a blade X for looking up. Yeah. So, the regular price was 6250 plus HST, but I guess you're looking at what I just counted you at the 8%, probably. So, yeah. No, that was before we discussed that. That was the price you gave me when I said I wanted a price on a 310. No, in our conversation at the end, you said if I paid cash, you'd give me 8% off. So, the 950 is what you quoted me before any of that. Yeah, so if you have you allow me to explain, we were looking at the 2.5 ton. If you see in the email, that was 5950. Yeah, it was 5,500, right? It was a, let me go back 5950. So, that was the 2.5 ton. But then, remember, we discussed you're like, let's just pump it to the 310. What's the difference? So, I emailed you back on May 9th and responded the cost of the blade X3 ton instead of the 2.5 is 6250 plus HST. Okay, let me find that. Yeah, just double check that. Because I know we were going back home. Yeah, I know. It should be on the same email thread. Okay, I just found it. Yeah. Yeah, and that also includes the, what do you call it? Smart thermostat. Smart thermostat. And it's the solution. Yeah, all in. Okay. And that's before the 8% of course. So, of course, what I quoted you with everything else on them, of course, we give the 8% for the certified check, you know, on top. Yeah. Yeah. Which would be, what was it, 84 ton. So, if we look at 8% it's 72, 73. Let's say 84 ton. 73. So, it essentially be 7738 plus HST with the 8% discount. Yes, HST. Okay. 7738 is what I just heard, right? Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, um, oh, and the other thing was that other thing that you had on offer. The energy treasure or whatever you call it. Yeah, we were offering it for that week. When are you looking to get this done? Right away. Right away. Okay. Um, yeah, I can include that, that info free. Okay. Okay. So, do you want to recap all of that and then come in what the next gap is? So, the next step, were you looking to do the audits and go through the government loan as well or no? I don't know if I qualify honestly because I'm a murp, I'm three units in a building, which remember I told you right from the beginning. I don't know if I can write it off. I don't know if I can write it off. But I am the building and I live in this unit. Yeah, yeah, you're right. So, it is. I wouldn't qualify anyway, but I want to know that I can write it off on my taxes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely. Mostly because I do have a lot of corporate, like a home that are, you know, properties under the corporation. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because my under the corporation, but I'm so long owner. So, so long. Yeah. Yeah. Because it's a murp, it makes things way more complicated. Yeah. And because it's a three unit, I don't think it would, it would qualify. And you know what? To write it off, doing it corporate, that's actually going to probably save you more in the long run. Versus, because with murbs, let's say yours did qualify, which I don't, the three units, what it does in it's only if it's two. But let's say it did, I mean, the audit fee is about $1,600 plus HSP. That's a loan. And that's something you have to get done with the, with the government loan. Right. So that's an additional expense. And then, you know, so probably end up working out a little bit better for you if you just do it the corporate way with, you know, with the discount that I'm giving you upfront. And then being able to write it off. And then, you know, I think it's a good thing to do it because I can't really do it for the other units because they're paying for little. I've had them as kind of for 15 years and they're paying like for a massive apartment like mine. Yes. And what you'd pay for a one bedroom, one bath. Oh wow. So it's just not something I'm not that generous. I mean, you know, if they were, you know, paying a reasonable amount, it would make sense. Yeah. It's not. Yeah. Yeah, I hear you. Okay, let's do it that way because I think it makes more sense. It's actually good that you're under it's under a corporation because being able to write it off is going to benefit you more for sure. Yeah. Now, I'd like the filter, the half a filter to go under my personal name. Because then I can write it off as a health benefit like a medical expense. Oh, okay, gotcha. Okay, so you might have to put it on a separate invoice, I think. Yeah. Is there any reason why you can't do that? No, no, I'm just, I'm just trying to think if there's like we can write a separate invoice for it. How long, how often do I have to change the filters by the way, too? Let me check with my, yeah, I like to check with my installation technical manager. I think, you know what, I don't want to give you your own answer. Let me just double confirm because it's, I think it also depends on the actual system you're getting installed. I know we go with, you know, very good quality systems. So I think it depends on that as well. But let me confirm that with you. What all of you Brenda is, why not you, you said as soon as possible. So are you looking for weekdays weekend? It doesn't matter. Well, I have a kind of a crazy time going on right now, but let me get my calendar out. Sure. I'm going to go to the next little bit. Yeah, and to do it, do you have to block off my driveway and stuff? To do the install. No, like they're going to hold on. You have like one vehicle maybe? Yeah, like to come with a work truck. So they come with a work truck and all of you know, I just remove my car. And you can go into my spot and not block anybody that way. And that way I don't have to make special arrangements with tenants. Okay, yep, that works. That works if you have, if you have a, like a spot. Yeah, it's like a work van, a work truck. Yeah, yeah, it's fine. I am away the fourth to the ninth of June. Next week, which is the last week, I don't know if it happens that fast, but I mostly be around. Next week, let me just double check. Except not Friday, Friday, late afternoon. Not Friday, late afternoon. Okay. I mean, you're in Toronto. So what's, uh, yeah, I'm basically killing Dundas. Yeah, our, like our, we had two head offices, one in Woodbridge, one in Toronto. Like that's where I'm located, north York. So we have guys all across Ontario, but we can, I mean, I can get someone in. Let me just see. We, I mean, we can do it as early as possibly this weekend or early next week, if that works for you. So this weekend, we're away, but Monday to Friday afternoon, like Friday noon, I'm good. Okay. Why don't we, what I can do is I can tentatively book you in for Monday, let's say. Okay. Once we go through the, so it's the virtual agreements and also we have to do the deposit as well. Right. Everything forwards over to our dispatch team, um, and operations team, they have access to all the, you know, all the technicians and experts availability. Um, and they can confirm it 100% but on my end, I see Monday shouldn't be an issue if that works. Okay. So Monday is the 27. Okay. So they'll confirm the time and all of that. And they're pretty flexible with that. So what I'll need to do in this case, um, Brenda in order to secure that in for you and kind of start the next step. I do need to send you the virtual agreement. Okay. You need to walk through it together. Is that okay with you? Yes. That's fine. What I'm going to do for now, just, just so it's easier for our team to see everything on one invoice. I'm going to put everything including the HEPA filter just for now to just start, you know, and import it, but I will write you a separate invoice with the HEPA filter under your name. Okay. Is that okay? Thank you. Yeah. That way just like when it comes to the pink because you're doing upfront and things like that, it's just easier for accounting to have everything on one invoice, but I will send you a separate invoice. That's not an issue. Um, okay. I just bear with me a moment. Let me go back to your file. And then before I send anything, uh, Brenda, I do of course want to confirm that I have the crack selling of your full name. Um, so Brenda, B-R-E-N-D-A. And then I have your last name, self as C-O-G-H-L-I-N. Yes. That's fine. That's my maiden name. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. So just bear with me. And the business number, do you need that? Do you have it? I don't think it's necessarily needed. You know what? I can write it down if you'd like me to put it in, but I don't think it's necessarily needed as long as the corporation is under your name, which it is. When you write it off, it's that's what they look at. They look at your phone. Yeah. Okay. So, uh, the corporation is probably underneath. So change it to N-I-E-V-E-A. And as a Norman. Yeah. I as an India, is an elephant, V as a Victor, is an elephant, S as in Sam. Okay. I'm just in the process of changing back to Cogland, but I haven't done it yet. So. Okay. Okay. No worries. Yeah. Let me let's do that because that, uh, that would be better than, you know, uh, okay. Let me go back and let me edit that in the system. Here. Okay. Brenda, just bear with me like two to three minutes. I'm still sure on the line. I'm just going to choose some upraving in your ear, but I'm just changing the name here and putting the agreement together. Okay. Okay. I'll share with me a couple of minutes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Mary, I'm calling you from Weaver, go home. I just wanted to have a virtual appointment scheduled with myself at two o'clock. We push it to two fifteen for the heat pump. Yeah. And do you receive the link to join? I try to do it and it seems like it doesn't work. I didn't hear him try to do it. For some reason it's not connecting. I'm not sure what. I'm in bad service for internet service. That's one thing. Oh, I see. Are you at home right now? No, I haven't found already because there's more service than at home. There's more service at home, right? No, at home, I don't have a home. Oh, you don't have internet. Oh, no, that's not good. Okay, no worries. If you don't have any access to internet service, we can alternatively do it over the phone. If that's easier. Yeah, it makes better for me. Okay, sure. No problem. Let me just disconnect. And we'll continue over the phone. So, Henry, thank you so much for joining me this afternoon. I have a very quick introduction to myself. So, again, my name is Miriam. I have had the pleasure of being with the company for about three years now. I've learned a lot about becoming more eco-friendly and more importantly helping homeowners become a lot more efficient with their homes. Okay. So, that is a little bit about myself. Henry, tell me a bit about yourself and what's the main goal or motive for getting a heat pump installed in the home? Well, the thing is I eat quid. And that's why I'm looking for some great upgrade. You know what I mean? Right. Yeah, yeah. Some newer. Yeah, so that affecting is... Sorry, go ahead. Is that affecting this great upgrade but it knows that ever something? Right. Yeah, so the heat pump is great because you're not just going to get the efficient cooling or AC. You're also going to get efficient heating, right? Yeah. So, heating and cooling. Now, how long have you lived in the home for? We live 11 years now. Just over. Come on over. Have you done any other upgrades since people are there to make it more efficient or would this be the first thing? That's the first thing for the furnace. Part for you to know. Okay. So, your AC system completely broke down like it's not working at all, right? It doesn't work at all now. The furnace works good but not at AC. Not AC. And you're on a gas furnace, right? Yes. How old is your furnace? I don't know. How does it build on a 1995? Okay. I'm assuming that I'm not sure but I'm assuming that the first one to put in. Is there a original one? I think that's where it is. But you said it's working fine. Like there's no issues currently with the furnace, right? Not if there is no issues. Okay. Okay. So that's good because with the heat pump system the AC needs to be replaced where you can keep your existing gas furnace as an emergency backup. Okay. Like heat source. So, are you familiar with the heat pumps, Henry, and you know how they work and what makes them know. Okay. So, I'll keep it as simple as possible because you can get kind of complicated or complex of the technology. But heat pumps run off of a law called thermodynamics. So, what that means is it uses the air to create heat exchange. And that's what's going to provide you with efficient heating and cooling throughout the year. Okay. Now, heat pumps do run solely off of electricity only. However, it does not use electricity to actually create the heat. It only uses electricity to simply transfer over the heat into your home. Okay. So, the electricity consumption with the heat pumps are very minimal and that's what makes them so efficient. Okay. Okay. Now, just to look at kind of the cost savings, how would you see your gas still goes into the winter time? Well, we looked at it yesterday. It's usually the cold winter and cold month. That's about 120. Between 120 and 120. That's somewhere. Okay. And then what was your hydro like in the summer when you had your AC running? I was, but high is one takes the... Okay. Let's go with that. All right. So, because I want to look at kind of the savings, the main savings you're going to see is for the gas. Because the heat pumps will heat up your home efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. Okay. So, only when temperatures get colder than that, which is not going to happen very often, especially in your area. Just during those extreme days, your gas furnace will kick in automatically as an emergency backup. Yeah. So, your gas still is going to be cut or reduced by about 80, 90 per cent or even more. Okay. Right. So, that's where you're going to see kind of the biggest savings. Okay. And I just want to confirm the square footage of the home. I have approximately 1,500 square feet. Yeah. It makes sense. Okay. And do you know the approximate tonsides of your AC system? I released one and a half tons. Okay. So, with the heat pumps, let me just double check. But I would, so with heat pumps, they're also calculated in tons. Okay. Yeah. But since it's incorporating heating now, it's not just cooling, right? It's heating and cooling. You always want to size up slightly with the heat pump. So, I would recommend the two tons for your home. Okay. Okay. So, that's what I'm going to quote you on here. And then I do also just want to mention, Henry, I'm sure you're probably aware of this as well. I know we mentioned it when we booked you in. The government was offering rebates in the past for heat pumps, but they got rid of all rebate programs as of January. Okay. But they did extend another incentive program that is coming to an end soon as well. But have you heard of it? The government zero percent interest free funding or loan for 10 years completely open? No, I never heard of it. So, essentially how it works is if you get approved, the government will give you the funds after you've installed it. I mean, you have to install it and pay for the product. We submit the invoice. And when the government has seen that you've gotten the product installed and, you know, invoice, they will give you the funds back and sold. And they give you a period of 10 years to pay it off at zero percent interest. Okay. Is that something you'd be interested in learning more about? No, no, no. But now I'm making it a fix because my kids and my wife are at a house and I'm worried about that. I'm sure they understand that. So, you're not interested in the incentive program you're looking to just pay up front? Yes. Okay, okay. So, then there's the need to have... I mean, it's... Yeah, go ahead. That's the right money, you know what I mean? The right price. For sure. I need it soon. That's because it's warmed off pretty quick and... Yeah, yeah, I hear you. I hear you. Okay. So, what I'll do then, let me go through the package details with you as far as what's in the package and the system. And then we'll get into the, you know, the savings and the cost breakdown. Okay. So, there's two major components to the hate pump. The first is the outdoor unit. This, of course, is what's going to replace your AC system or unit. And then there's the internal part of the heat pumps that connects to the outdoor unit. It's called a Unix-Taste Coil. This is what we connect, you know, in or on your existing furnace. Again, we do use the cold climate heat pump system. So, just to confirm the heat pump will run efficiently anywhere between minus 25 to minus 30. So, they do kind of run in conjunction or communicate hungry, but they are still two completely separate systems. Yeah. So, you know, just to confirm the heat pump will run to that temperature and then temperatures that get colder than that. The gas furnace will kick in automatically as an emergency backup. Okay. Okay. So, again, that's where you're going to see the biggest savings because the heat pumps are so efficient to that temperature. You know, you're probably going to knock off your gas about 80, 90% in the winter. Okay. Okay. Now, do you have a smart thermostat at home? No. So, we're going to include a brand new generation model smart thermostat that's compatible with the full system. And then we have our warranty, the good thing with the warranty is it is done separately or directly through us. It's not just a basic manufacturing warranty. For this standard, we give you 10 years on all parts one year labor and you do have 24 seven service and access to it at all times. Okay. Okay. So, that's essentially our full package there. Henry, now, I guess before I get down to the cost breakdown, just to quickly touch up on the savings. So, for just to keep it simple, I mean for gas. So, if I look at the average there, so you're spending, let's say, just under 2000 a year, it looks like on your gas bill. Yeah. Okay. So, basically with these heat pumps, like I said, the main thing is the winter and the heating. It's going to save you anywhere between 80 to 90%. So, even if we looked at, let's say, about 80% savings for the year, just to kind of give you a quick idea. That means you're going to be saving about 1500 annually. And again, that's just based on what you spent probably as of last year. I'm not sure if you know as of April 1st, they actually increased federal carbon tax and fuel cost. So, unfortunately, next winter, the gas prices are going to go off, right? But 1500, if we break that down monthly, you're going to save about 130 bucks a month, you know, when you switch over to the system. Just to do, you know, quick easy math. Now, let's get to the cost. So, the cost that I'm going to give you, Henry's is basically going to confirm, or going to include rather the full package that I just went over with you. So, just to quickly confirm, it's the full cold climate hybrid heat pump system, the outdoor unit, indoor unit, the smart thermostat, the warranty, and then full installation as well. Okay, yeah. So, and then we're looking at the two tons. Let's just see the two tons. So, you'd be looking at 6000 even plus HST, all in. Okay. So, that includes the install and warranty as well. Everything by time we told them. Yeah, that's all in 6000 even plus HST. I talked to my wife and talked to her about it and I'll get back to you. Yeah, and if you said you're not interested in the government program, you're okay to pay up front. So, in that case, if you do pay up front, we do give in a little bit of an additional incentive. I can give you an additional 5% off that price, which means I can take off $300. So, that means I can bring it down if you're looking to just pay up front. 57 plus HST. Okay. And how long I would take you if I pay it and install it. How long are you looking to get? You said as soon as possible. Yeah. So, you're in Langton, right? Yeah. Let me just double check, because we have experts all across Ontario, so I would assign someone in your area. So, we could get it done within the next few days, like less than a week for sure. Like probably the next two to three days. I'll talk to my wife, maybe today yet, and I'll call you back. How's that sound? So, what do we do this? I'm going to send you a quick email with all the information. You want to talk to your wife today? I'm in the office till about 630-ish. I can give you a quick shout before it head out if that works. Yeah. And then we can take the next steps from there. Sounds good. I appreciate it. Okay. Okay. So, I'm good. Henry, I'll send you that email, and I'll give you a call between 6 and 630, and we'll go from there. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much. Take care now. Bye-bye.

This is, Hey, John is Alex from Weaver regarding, I just got your email. I'm doing pretty well. How are you? Good, good. Yeah, Alex, I wanted to go over that quote, you sent over. Are you guys, you guys are based in Vaughn? We are. We are. Are you in the States? We are in Canada. So we are actually by February, which is close to North York. OK, so you guys have a shop there or do you guys just, you guys just a call center? We are ahead office. So all of our team is in pretty much like our part of it is, we do have the sales guys. We have the project management team, you know, all the financing, everything is in here. We do have another shop, which is all our inventory, the technicians, all of that stuff, but we handle the process. They just show up to your home and do the installation and all the service costs and stuff like that. OK, yeah, so I'm just looking over the quote. So let me just pull up your, your, sorry, let me just pull up the file. Hold on, sorry. Yeah, so your quote was, I believe, so, 8900 was a tax and let me take a look at it here. So you got a cold climate heat pump outdoor and indoor unit, TOSR 2.0, 2.0, outdoor. Yes, it was the dockless one, right? Yes. Perfect. And when we spoke, you mentioned that you were considering, like, paying it upfront, no financing, nothing like that, right? Well, yeah, this, this one is an upfront cost, or is this, did this include financing? That one here, let me take a look. I believe though, the price that I gave you, gave because you decided you wanted to do upfront. I think I did give you a discount because of the, there's an upfront of one payment. So that goes with the one payment. Yes, let me do that quickly here. Yeah, so I wrote the number I believe, 8150 plus taxes. So it's 9200. 9200 or 90. Yes. So that's that we can't finance it with that. With that, it would be if you decide to pay it upfront. If you want to finance it, the good thing is that we do have it. It is a little bit more flexible. You can get, you know, if you get approved the full funds at $7.99 interest for $95. What we could do if you decide to finance it is that we can apply for you for the government loan if you're interested in it. How would the thing go? If you have that, it has to come to your house and check everything out. They would have to, we would have to schedule you for an audit. The energy audit is just for them to, you know, check it out and it's pretty much like a validation for them to actually, like, see that you needed it. The good thing is that the cost of that audit could be added to the loan as well. The only benefit of that loan is that is, is here percent interest. So, so how much, how much would you say with the government, with the government loan, with the government rebate? Like, would they, it came to the houses out a lot of heat loss. It's like a hundred-year-old cottage. Like, are they going to go there and say, well, you need this, this is not done before you get the upgrade. Yeah. Before you can get the rebate, what kind of rebate is it? It's not a rebate, it's just a loan. Oh, yeah. So essentially, they will give you the, that amount, they will give you the total amount. They will give you that amount in a loan and you can just pay it off in the next 10 years. And there's no interest on it. There's no interest on it. Yeah. And what would the cost, there's a cost for them to go and check it out? I $750. Okay, so just go back to this, so it would be $920950 with tax. So the toll stock, so if this is with two indoor units? It is with two indoor units, yes. And the toll stock, how long is that, this model, this brand been around? Because I haven't really heard of it. They've been around a very long time because they're manufactured by Media Ingrid, which is the two biggest manufacturers in the world. The biggest thing with them is that they are almost like very similar to Goodman. Have you, I'm sure you've seen Goodman, right? No, I haven't seen the Goodman, no. They're very similar to Goodman. Compared to them, so quality, like a efficiency level is up to 25. Is their coal climate, all the model that we carry is our coal climate, so there would be essentially what is the coal that we're down to minus 30? Okay. And is it 10-year warranty on it, and one-year-parts in labor? I, 10-year's parts, one-year labor. Ten-year parts. So the parts is basically the compressors, that's the only thing that's the only thing that's the big thing of it? Or, I mean, all around, like if you ever come across any difficulty with the brand, like with the parts? Oh, it gets the parts or shipper, and you just have to get the labor to install it after the labor. Yes. Okay, and what, what's the, does this get mounted? Did I see some pictures of, does it get mounted? Like on your house or is it going, or does it go on a cement pad? It depends of your home. Every home is a little bit different. I have seen them both. Sometimes it goes on the floor, sometimes they hang it on the side of the wall. It depends of the home. Okay. You were looking at two heads, right? For this island. So, it's the right street, both four with two heads. So, it's 18,000 BTU, right? Yes. And then you would, if we decided to go ahead, would there be like an inspection by your team to come and take a look and say, well, this is going to go here. This is going to go here. This is going to go here. You guys haven't really seen the place. We do a assessment installation same day. So, they would do, they would do an assessment before they install it to get you approval on everything where they're going to place it, how they're going to do it, how it's going to be connected inside. Once we get your approval, you, we have the green light that will install it. Okay. And how long would an install take? Like if we decided to go ahead, I had talked to my wife, I'm just, I have another call with another guy, or four. I know that place is good. This is the other brand that they're using a different brand. It's a little bit more expensive, but it's more of a, it's a few, too, a little bit more expensive. Just out of curiosity, what brand are they doing? Uh, could you do? Oh, okay, okay. Yeah, so it's, I think it's a more of a well known brand, I think it's been around longer. But it isn't a little bit more expensive. So I'm going to just talk to them. But if we did just back to go ahead with you, Alex, is it just the department that we put down and then? What I would do is I will forward you the agreement. We've been data, we've been that agreement. It's going to be everything stated on it. And then what we could do is, you know, if you decide to sign in, go forward with us, we would pretty much we would take a 500 dose deposit. That deposit gets rolled into the total amount anyways. So from there, we would, my team will call you to schedule you an installation. We are pretty good. We can probably be there anytime within the next week or whenever you know time worked for you and your schedule. And we will try to do assessment and installations same day, probably like a four to five hour period. You know, we always, I always give time a little bit more than I actually is just in case. Okay, and this is your best price you can do, right? You can't do better than this, right? Yes, that's the best price I can do. Okay. Okay. Let me, I'll, I have another call and I'm going to talk to my wife. I'm going to, I'll call you back tomorrow for sure, Alex. Hello, how are you working tonight? Today, I'm here until seven. What I can do is I can put everything in the, I can put everything in the agreement. I'm going to go forward to you. And if you guys still decide not to go with us, there's no harm. It's just like a paper. Yeah, you guys can see everything in writing. And then regardless of if it's a yes or no, just let me know regardless. Okay, no, I appreciate it. Amazing. Thank you.

I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. Yeah. Okay. Just reaching out to lay in about some updates in the market. The previous rebate program, it has transitioned. And the government is now offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. If you know about this before. I know that, but how much of your charging? Yeah, well, I myself work as an appointment booker, but I can do as I can connect you with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the prize and we'll discuss the product with you as well. Okay. Okay. Can you just tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? Uh, 62. Is it a bungalow or two stories full of attached home? Bungalow. What's the house size and its car feed like roughly? 15 hundred square feet. And do you have a gas furnace in your home? Gas. Gas furnace? No. No. No furnace. Oh, you have a electric base work? No, this but I have a heat pump already. It's 2.5. What do you call it? Turn or whatever? Yeah. And I don't want to use and it's by heating like with the oil and thermo pump. But I don't want the oil heating with it. I just want a thermo pump to work as is. So maybe I require a treat on something. I see. Do you have ductwork in your home or now? That's work. It's there. It's there. That's why heat pump is working. So is it like connected to an oil furnace? To what? How is it connected to the ductwork? Oil furnace. Oil furnace. I don't like that. I don't like that. Because it's too much oil. Yeah, true. And it's expensive. And it's the space covering is true. Only for the, you know, yeah, I agree. I agree with you. Yeah. What do you think I want to know? Sorry, what? Go ahead. You're your your your own. How old is the heat pump itself? No, I think it's seven years or six years something like that. Do you want to get a needle heat pump? Yeah, I want to have a heat pump, which is working without the furnace. Look, that's for. In that case, where you can have it, like with the heat pump, you always need to have a furnace because the heat pump it doesn't directly get connected to the ductwork, right? But what you can do as you can get a heat pump with an air handler. The air handler is basically an electric furnace, which you can use as a backup. Okay. So whatever. And I don't have to have oil then that's yeah, I know oil. Yeah. So that's it. So I need a hole and everything. Sure. And how much you are not charging me? How much are charging me? Okay. Absolutely. The house is your primary residence and you are the homeowner correct? Yeah. Well, how much what is the average monthly electricity bill just a rough idea? Oh, I'm saying like $2200 per year. For electricity? Yeah. And what about oil? How much does that cost you annually? $1,000, five liters, 500 liters. So it's on top. How much? So every year, how many do you pay for oil? So this year, I don't say I don't shoot oil. I don't use furnace with oil. I use an extra heater. And that saves me a lot of money. So that's me $1,000 I saved this year. That's it. Okay. And the last year, if when you were using your oil furnace, how much did you pay on oil last year? $22 plus. $22 plus. $900. Or something like that. Okay.

20240522-151734_2203_+19057730626_Outgoing_Auto_2197852236043.mp3," May I help you? Hi, I'm D'Aufton Owen. My name is Gina and I can speak to Eric. Just a moment please. Thank you. Hello, Eric speaking. Hi, I'm D'Aufton, Eric. My name is Gina and I was talking to you last month regarding the Manage Turbo Extra Venue Show License Application. Yes. Okay. Yeah, I did not get back to you, Eric, because we kind of changed our market strategy. So that's why I put that in hold. But however, I'm contacting you because we put our money to buy a plan and hold in one to do BC. Do you do this kind of stuff in BC? We do. Yes. Okay. All right. So we already have an extra provincial license with BC. However, my research said if you want to do direct sales in Vancouver or other nearby cities and municipalities, we need to get licenses and permits to give you a background. Again, we're an HVAC company and we wanted to do daughter-door sales. So we wanted someone to apply on our behalf the licensing and permits for a city. Oh, I see. Okay. That's that sort of thing we don't do. So all we do is incorporate, we only do the corporate registrations. As far as applying for specific licenses, it doesn't really make sense for you to hire somebody to do that. I mean, the thing is that there's no legal knowledge required for those types of registrations. They're going to be asking business questions rather than anything that you'd need legal knowledge for. So that's the reason most lawyers don't get involved with that kind of thing. Right. All you do is you contact them in municipalities where you want to do business. And also the provincial government to find out if there's direct seller licenses that's required for British Columbia. I can tell you that just give me one sec. But in terms of what we do, it's the corporate extra-preventual registrations. Okay. Direct sellers. So yeah. So you need PST registration. PST? PST, provincial sales tax. Okay. It ultimately depends on the PST depends on specifically the type of products that you're selling. And then consumer protection BC has direct sales, contract requirements. And then each municipality then regulates. But I mean, if you're looking for a lawyer to help you to tell you specifically what's required for each jurisdiction, we can do that research for you. But there's also websites that you can do that. There's something called biztowel.ca. B-A-Z-P-A-L-D-C-A. I'm sorry. Let me just go that. It's B. B is in Bob. I-Z-P-A-L. C-A-L-Tango-All-F-Lima. No, no, no. Papa-Alpha-Lima. Okay. B is Paul. Dot-C-A. So if you go to that website and you put in, it'll ask you what's your business, where do you intend to operate the business, it'll give you a list by municipality. Well, you put in the municipality, but it'll give you a list of what you need. Okay. Right. Okay. So if you think it's case that say, for example, I'm not confident to do it, I want to do it right and I want to hire a counselor or a lawyer who will advise us what to do. How much is your rate? Eric. Yes. So for something like that, it would be $275 an hour. $275 an hour. Yeah. Okay. Right. Okay. Let me think about it and let me just see what we have used to reach. Yeah. Like I say, most people don't do it and that's the reason that we don't really offer it as a service because it does not. It's expensive. It's expensive and it's time consuming and so the whole, because every jurisdiction is a little bit different, so it's not like I can give you a single answer with just telling you, you know, oh, it's this. It's very specific as to what you're doing, where you're doing it, how you're doing it, whether you have employees in that jurisdiction, different things like that. And so, and with most of it, it's not a matter of interpreting the law. It's or preparing paperwork in a specific way. It's just contacting, it's basically contacting the relevant government authorities, but usually by phone is what we do. We just say to them what's going to be required and they give us a list and, and then we'll tell you, but the applications themselves are generally fairly straightforward. They don't, they don't need any legal knowledge. They're just like, where's your business located? How are you going to be selling? How much are you going to be selling? Sometimes there's bonding requirements, but they generally don't require any specialized knowledge. Okay. I see. All right. Okay, so I heard consumer protection BC, CDO Vancouver, so the DSOR, the organizations that I need to reach out to in order for me to get information apart from the DSPAL.CA website. Yeah, those would be the primary ones. I might need to contact. And then also you have to look at the tax impact. So whether you do need PST because in British Columbia, it's not HST, it's GST and PST. So, and PST does apply to certain product sales. It depends on for a product, depends, I think, on whether it's being attached to the real property or whether it's something separate. But either way, it's something you need to look at to determine based on the specific products that you sell, whether PST registration is going to be required. Okay. Right. All right. Sounds complex to me, but thank you for your advice. Okay. And yeah, for my name, to Boba, I'll get back to you as soon as we were directed our marketing strategy to that province. Okay. So all right. Thank you so much, Eric. You're welcome. Take care. All right. Bye.

Can you just tell me a bit about your home like? When was your house built? I believe it was in 1919. It's like it's an old century country, old home. How many floors? There's the basement, main floor upstairs and an attic. So, four floors? Okay. And what's this core footage of the house? Any idea? No, I'm not too sure.

And how will it live? It's like 10 years old, something like that. This is your primary residence and your ABA homeowner, correct? What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. Monthly, I used to be a duplex, so I kind of got two bills. Kind of distorted. But I'm guessing year average would probably be 150. I'm 40. I have no electric cars. You said the house is like a duplex like Canada? It was. It's being re-converted back into a home. But yeah, it still has a two electrical. Okay. For now. Sure.

I'm going to send you the Google Meet link to your email address tomorrow morning so you can join us at 6 p.m. You can use it in your account or your computer is up to you. One question. Yes. So this program goes through. Are they going to, is the ultimate I'm going to be that they have to take my furnace with them? No. Okay. Your furnace is only 10 years old. Do you think, right? Yeah. So if it's like working all good, you have no issues with that. You don't need to get rid of that. You keep your furnace as a backup. That's what I was hoping. Yeah. Yeah. Because I do want to get rid of my central air. Sure. I have central air. And senior age. Put lots of fish in. And a heat pump would be. But yeah, heat pumps not very efficient. One is like minus 20. So I would probably want to use my furnace when it was like minus 20 outside. Yeah. We also kind of like put the. Set the heat pump at minus 20. They actually work like till minus 27. But the efficiency drops when it goes beyond minus 20. So we just said it at minus 20. So the heat pump turns off. And then the furnace kicks in when it goes beyond minus 20. Okay. Yeah.

You can submit your inquiry at any time using our online form at Vancouver.ca For its slash contact-licensing. Hi, my name is Gina and I'm calling from Ontario. I want to inquire about application for business license and permits. We just give you a background. We are an HVAC company in Ontario and we wanted to expand in BC. What I have right now is we have a statement of registration and certificate of registration. I was called BC Registry and they said that this is not sufficient for us to do direct sales. What we wanted to do is to do daughter-girl sales for each VAC unit and this is our business activities. Can you just give me an overview of what needs to be done, what permits or licenses. I need the secure in order for us to move forward. I can only address the city of Vancouver. I'm not sure about the other municipalities. For the city of Vancouver, you would first need a business license. I would be filling out the general business license application form. Then on the form, you would just describe your business. For the HVAC, will you have a brick and mortar location that you will be operating out of? You would have an office. What are your requirements? Basically, this is just gathering information for us to get an office. We have an address that we still don't have a physical office. I will submit to the direction that you wanted me to. Your company would most likely need to have, not most likely, will need a business license to work in the city of Vancouver. Secondly, the contractors, they can either be employees of your company. If that is the case, then they wouldn't need a business license because when they apply, they would be using the company's business license if they need to apply for specific permits. If I understand it well, say for example, we have an employee there. We will go into someone who will work there as an employee in our payroll. What does it mean? I think for city of Vancouver, under HVAC, they may need to get different permits like a mechanical permit or plumbing permit. I don't know the types of jobs that you guys do. It may be necessary to apply for these additional permits in order to apply for these additional permits, you first must have the business license. The first step is to apply for business license. Because you would be applying under the out of town business license category, the out of town. I think that just actually goes under the general business license application process. I'm on your website and what page are you on? What do you see? Doing business? That's it? Under business license and permits. There is another option of business licenses and for business license. There are three options. Get a business license. Then go down to where it says the steps. I'm sorry. Step one. We are on HVAC company and there is what is the option that I need to choose. There can be a clothing film, residential, soliciting special events, trade and construction. Step four. Fill out application form and it will be not the home-based one. It's the one that says if you click on apply online, and then you just start filling out this. The other thing with HVAC companies here is that there is a company like yourself and then you contract out the work. Say for example, the first scenario is to hire someone as an employee, and the other option that we are looking at is to have a subcontractor. Those subcontractors would need to have their own business licenses. Okay, like a technician, but to use subcontracted technician. They would need to have a business license license. Okay, so preferably it would be easier if we hire an employee. Correct? That's correct. You have control over everything and the employee and the work and all of that stuff. The subcontractors, they are their own business so they need to have their own business license. So the other question is, do you require a physical address? Now we have an address, but there is no physical address. But we have an address. Okay, that's fine. Five of the subcontractors are working out of their home. Their home is their office address. Okay, but when we have, I'm just saying, but when we send an employee, does that change the scenario? No, because that person is an employee of the company, of which the address that you have is the company address. So we have a physical address? No, no. You're in Ontario, you said? Yeah, we are. No, you can use it around the area address. Okay. Yeah, but we have an address. Okay, no, as long as we don't need a physical address, I'm fine with that. So business license. Do you know if once after this, do you know how much do I need to pay for a business license? Or I will just get it from this portal. I think it's on the site. It's not an exact amount because the business license office will review it. So, to each fact. So there's the application fee that you will pay. And then specifically the license office, the type of business, and that sort of thing they will let you know. Construction. I'm just looking at some lists here. Yeah, they don't even list the fees. Even if you see that business license, they may give categories, but the actual license fee is not listed. Okay, I could put it under something like special trades or contractor, special trades or just contractor. So they will let you know what category and the fee. I see. Okay, so once the business license is issued, what will be the next tab? I will apply for the permit. Yeah, so once your business license is issued, and if the work that you're doing requires another permit, then you would just be using your license number to attach to your application for any type of specific permits, like a mechanical permit or plumbing permit. I see. And okay. In Ontario, the door to door sales activity is not allowed. How about in this inventory? Interesting question. One moment, please. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Next, of course. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. One cover. I'm on call, which is the phone cover. But I'm on queue. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Okay, proceed to document. It's loading. Okay, so let's go through. You received it there Brenda? Yes. Okay, perfect, perfect. So it's pretty easy if you just open it up there and I think you have to click on start and then proceed to document. So it should bring you there on the first page. You've got three. And I get five times. Yeah, we don't, that was, there's a bit of issue with the model numbers on my system. So it just put in the 3.5. So that's fine. I mean, three or 3.5, it means even better for your home. So that's it's the same price. It won't have to work too hard or something because it's not at all. Okay, not at all. I'm going to leave a note on the system that's, it's a three ton, but if you get a three, if you get a half ton more, if anything, it will actually benefit or be better, to be honest. Okay. You don't want to go too big, but within half a half a ton, it's not going to cause issues at all. Okay. Actually, you'll probably work a little bit better. But yeah, I just, if you want to just confirm on that page. So it's all the two, the full heat pump system. I included the full, have a filter, the smart thermostat with the two heat room sensors included in the price and in the full warranty. Okay. And full warranty. Can you put in just for me, part and labor? Yeah, if you go actually scroll down a little bit, do you see it? It's going to be a lot. Yeah, underneath the notes, you'll see it says, warranty and it says, 10 years, parts, 10 years labor. So that's, like, that's on the agreement. Good. Yeah, I didn't want any confusion later down the road. Yeah, yeah, no, for sure, for sure. We're going to find, like I said, we do it through the insurance. So once we get it in, we're going to actually, what do you call it? Assign an insurance number for you. So it's going to be attached to your name in your home. But yeah, it's in there. So this is just, this is easy. You just have to, all you have to do is just sign it and print your name. And then what I'm going to do is afterwards, I do need to send you a separate security link for the deposit. Because we don't put that on the agreement. We have a secure link that we send. Okay, when I tried to try to, oh, does it take a signature? No. Oh, did you click on it? I put in I tried to. Did you click on exception, continue at the top? Because it doesn't until you do that. It doesn't allow you to. I confirm that I, that I read and understood the electronics. Signature disclosure. Is that the one? Yes. Yeah, yes. You just have to accept that or continue. And then it allows you to type in your name and signature and all that. Okay, because it's kind of. Okay. And I should you have apartment one on it, because that's where you're doing the work. I'll put the note on there, like on our, on our system. And don't worry about the agreement, but I'll put it to apartment one. Okay. Oh, okay. So let me just leave a note on your file here, so apartment one. No, it's still not working. Click here to start finding. Okay. I did. Oh, okay. There. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That seems to be it, right? Yeah. Once you complete everything, like there's a couple of signatures and date, you should see it. Okay. Let me just see what I missed. Okay. I don't see anything else. I only see one and then finish. Okay. Oh, then, yeah, sorry, then just click on finish and see if it. Okay. And then. And then what are you getting on your end there? I'm getting I can print it. Oh, yeah. So that means you can see that it. So you can print it. You can email. We're going to email you a copy right away. Okay. I just received it and you're going to get an email copy as well. Okay. So then that's good. And then what I'm going to do is I'm just emailing you the. Where is it here? There we go. And when do you think they'll be coming in like when did they start in the morning? Yeah. I think the dispatch and operations will have to confirm because they have access to all the technicians like all their schedules. They'll try to come in. Yeah, they'll probably give you a call today to confirm it. And they usually try to come a bit earlier like, you know, maybe 10, 11 o'clock because it's, you know, it's going to take at least. So they'll try to coordinate it a little bit earlier in the day. Okay. I did also. We can find a place to put the car. Yeah. Yeah. So what I'll do now Brenda is I'm going to send over the or forward the agreement over to our operations and dispatch team. And then they'll be in touch with you to coordinate the exact day and time. So then that way you can coordinate with them and figure out your car situation so the guys can, you know, take your spot. Okay. I just emailed you. Sorry. Yeah, I didn't pay attention. Okay, a payment of $500. Can I, how do I do it? Can I do it? You just eat trans first for this one. Make it easy because I have no time for the rest of the week. What you can do. It. This is actually much much quicker. It's so if you just click on the link, you just have to put your credit card. Okay. It's my credit card. And then paypal because I hate paypal. No, no, no, no, I know I hate paypal. I've had bad experiences at paypal. So no, no, this is your credit card. And we prefer this way. Then, you know, we like it because it's a security link through squares. So it's a security link. And then paypal. And then paypal. So that's what we prefer to do at this way than on the actual agreement with all your information. Yeah. Okay. Update 3810 is not good anymore. I was with hsbc and royal bank took it over. So. So, you know, you can just update. Right. Yep. Because the rest, the previous one won't work at all. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, it says it's invalid. Maybe I didn't put it in right in the check. Oh, yes. I was dyslexic there. Oh, I'm. Oh, phone number. Thank you. You know what we like about? on your end. It says securities deposit, yes, 500 card processing sheet zero sub total 500 order total 500 and I don't see anything else. And you put in your credit card. Yeah. The receipt. Oh, the receipt has been sent. Okay, okay. Let me quickly check on I should be able to see it here. Yeah, yeah, it says completed on my end. Okay. Okay. Show it. Okay. Yeah, no worries. I see it's completed. You should get a copy of our sheet that it's been paid on your end as well. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. So Brenda, I know, I know you have to get going soon. Just super quickly. What I'm going to do is I'm going to forward everything over to our dispatch and operations team. They'll probably be in touch with you. If not today, for sure, first thing tomorrow. And again, we'll tentatively book it in for Monday, the 27th, but they'll 100% come from the day in the time with you. That way you can coordinate with them in the parking spot with your car. Okay. Sounds good. And then oh, just one thing Brenda, if you don't mind, you can either email me or you can text me on this number, whatever you prefer, whatever is easier. We just usually ask for a couple of pictures, one picture of your panel box and one or two pictures of your furnace. That way I forwarded over to my team and just so they can have a super quick look at what you currently have, make sure they have all the materials when they go there on the 27th. Okay. So yeah, you can email that to me or you can text me on this number. Operations will probably ask you for that as well, but the sooner you can the better for that. And then that's pretty much it. The team will be in touch to coordinate. Oh, this is what I was going to mention since you're doing up front and you're going to do cash or certified check, it will be the amount after the deposit, of course. So let's say you're scheduled for the 20. I need to have that for you because I need to go to a bank. My bank. Yeah. The day of the day that they get the book, the install. So let me just. I'll have to scoot out and get something because I won't be around till then. Okay. Yeah. That's fine. But it's the amount. It's only agreement as well. The amount after the deposit 82, 43, 4. So yeah, if you can just have that one, the guys are there that way after they complete it because they'll get everything done within the day, then you can just give it to the guys after the install. Yeah. Okay. All right. Requesting. So I'm still getting just a request. I haven't got the receipt yet. So you'll make sure it gets for the deposit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's try. It should see it's completed on your end. Yeah. Let me look on my empty. It says. Yeah. Show any receipt. Okay. Let me check on my end. Maybe it takes maybe it takes a bit of time to receive it.

As are you putting in Korean or Facebook ad for a hit bump? Yes that's possible. I want to know where I don't remember. I'm just wondering how much it cost. Sure Gilbert, first of all, I think like we do. Can you say Gilbert? Sorry what? My name is Gilbert. Gilbert? Instead of G, put the G or G. Okay J, okay. Gilbert or Gilbert? Gilbert. Okay, Gilbert. All right, sure. Thank you for letting me know. So first of all, let me let you know about some updates in the market. There used to be a rebate program which has transitioned. And at the moment, government is offering funds at a 0% interest rate. Did you know about this before? That's for bigger innovation. I know with them bridge, I could get a rebate on the hit pump, but the program is off now. It's over. Yes, true. However, you can still take advantage of the interest-free fund program in case you qualify. So they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a hit pump installed in your home at your present interest. So that's another incentive program going on, which you can definitely take a look into. And that would fit the role of the provincial. Yeah, that's right. Okay, but again, that if I'm not crazy, it's for low income. Not really. No, it's not based on the income at all. Oh, okay. Yeah, they have a criteria like you should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. It is. And it shouldn't be a new build house because new build houses are not qualified. It has to be at least it's. 1912 building. Oh, awesome. And it should have been. It should have been. It should have been. It should have been. And it should have been. And it shouldn't be a condo or a apartment. It has to be a house. It's a house to a story house. Awesome. And you should be a Canadian citizen or a pure folder with a very credit score. And that's it. Okay. Okay. Now, Gilbert, Gilbert, Gilbert, I'm going to set up an online consultation. Sorry, but. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, no worries. I'm going to set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will provide you with the prize and the product that we offer. Okay. Okay. Now, your health. And I'm sorry because I remember another one maybe I signed two. But I came to their website and they were like pushing our putting in in front. But like insulation, the added you do that. Because we don't need that. Yeah, no, not really. I just got your inquiry for hidden and cool empty heat pump. So we're just going to put it on that. Okay. Okay. So, you know, it's just a bit confusing. Maybe the other one I asked to get some information when I went to their website after I sent my information. It was like, you were showing more like about insulation, the addik. And we don't have a addik. It's a flat truth. Oh, I say okay. No worries. Yeah, it should be good. We're just going to focus on heat pump. Okay. So, your house, it's a fully, two stories fully detached. What's this? Curfew and the idea? No, it's a semi detached. Let me. Okay. And what's the house size and the square feet? Roughly? I would see 17, 18, 100. Okay. And the square feet with the basement. Okay. With the basement, 2000. Okay. No worries. And the... The HC we have already here is a two ton. Okay. And do you have a gas furnace in your home? Yes. It's a train we've been... We changed a few years ago, again, with some rebate with the embridge. And we got the water tank change for a tankless one. Okay. But it's... It's very good. If it's something better than the one we have, I might think about changing it because I have to say I'm not very... Satisfied and impressed because they sold the idea, water tankless. You have hot water right away, but that's not true because it comes from the basement. When it comes up, it's always like your 20 or 35 section. Or it's not that cool. Oh, I see. It's not that quick. Oh, I see. Okay. So, I'm going to give you another option of possible, why not? Now, the first is, how old is that your gas furnace? Let me go downstairs to the basement. The day did smart on the second. Yeah, take your time. 2019. Very good. And this houses your primary residence and you are in the homeowner, correct? Yes, and no more mortgage, everything is fixed. Very good. What's the average monthly electricity bill? Just a rough idea. But now I'm on the equal payment for the first time and it's $80. What about your gas, the embridge? Embridge. Give me one section. Yeah. I would say 65. How much do you get the gas for and winters? For me? And winters, how much do you pay for gas? That's on the 12th payment, the equal payment. It's an equal payment, so you pay monthly, the exact 65. 65 throughout the year? Okay. And the electricity is 80, you say it, right? Yeah. Okay. Now the email address, what I have here is your last name, your first name at gmail.com. Is that correct? Okay. But I have here like G-I-L-B-E-R-T. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have it like that.

I thought you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. I'm just reaching out to you, let me know about some updates in the market. The previous rebate program is has transmission and the government is now offering funds at a viewer percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? No, I don't know what you just said. Oh, no worries, let me just repeat it. There used to be a rebate program which actually ended on January this year. However, at the moment, government is offering funds at viewer percent interest rate. It means that if you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat bump in your home without any interest. What I can see is I can set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will discuss this program with you and go through her numbers as well. Now, can you just tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? It was built in 1960. It's bungalow, one floor, about 1200 square feet. And maybe it's 1400, I don't know. And the basement's finished, the main floor is done. I don't think there's been any insulation upgrade yet ever. No worries. Do you have a furnace at the moment? I have a natural gas furnace and my air conditioners almost on the brink of being half-negative replaced. So I'm kind of thinking doing a heat pump thing for a little extra money and then save on the natural gas part. That's really nice. It might be cheaper, I don't know. Sounds good. And the front is how old is that one? It was put in in 2004, I think. It's got an event system, it's not an old style with the opportunity. It's got the plastic inlet and outlet. Oh my God. It's working all good. It's awesome. This has your primary residence and your easy homeowner, correct? That's right. What's the average monthly electricity bill just the rough idea? I think it's about 300, 300, 300. And what about the gas? The gas can be up to 120, 140, and then from there, like that's for say December January and February, and then it drops off to, you know, I don't know. The total thing, I don't know what the gas could be probably, I don't know, probably 1,200 bucks a year for gas. Sure, I got it. Now the email address, what I have here is Lauren Funt at gmail.com, is that correct? Yep. And the home address is mentioned here only on Torio. Can I give you that address, please? 841 Denmark Street. How do you sell it? 841 DEN, M-A-R-K. Sorry, Nia? Very good. Now Lauren, for the online meeting, I do have availability for tomorrow, tomorrow at 2 PM, 5 PM, and 6 PM. What time do you prefer? I don't know. I don't like online stuff. I don't like online stuff. I don't like online stuff. I don't like online stuff. We can try it like, it's kind of like Google Meet, which is like Zoom Meet. Have you done any Zoom Meet before? No, well I've done it and I don't like it. Okay. Because we actually kind of like create a presentation for the heat pump analysis, so we would like to share that with you. Yeah, sure. Whatever. That should be good with you. Okay. We can try a, like, an over-the-fault meeting, like a phone call tomorrow at 2 PM, 5 PM, and 6 PM. Which one do you prefer? 5 PM. Sure. I have a DEN for tomorrow at 5 PM. Tomorrow you'll get a call from us at 5 PM. You can just pick it up and have a talk. Sounds good? Sounds good. All right, thank you for your time, Lauren.

So tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? 1873. Is it a bungalow or a two story? It's a two story. What's the house size and the square feet like roughly? 2700 square feet. Do you guys have a furnace at the moment? Yes, we do. It's brand new. It was replaced two years ago. Very good. It's the natural gas or propane. Yes, natural gas. This house is your primary residence and you guys are in the owner, right? Yes, correct. Yes. What's the average monthly electricity and gas bill? Just a rough idea. In the summer or the winter? In the summer for like average, like annually, how much do you pay for electricity and gas? I would say in the area of our hydro bill runs us anywhere between $200 and $300 a month. What about gas? Our gas bill in the winter season right now runs us about 4 to 600 a month and in the summer it runs us in the area of 100. Okay, perfect. I got a shirt from October to February. We're running anywhere between $400 and $600 a month. So the cost that was six months at that rate. Okay, I got it. Okay. Now the email address just to confirm I have a K-beard 888-hotmail.com address. I don't know if Kurt has that. I've never heard of that email address. How can I get another one then? Sure, I can give you my email address. It's fine. Okay, so it's DMCB1970 at hotmail.com. I have a huge cold right now. Oh, it's okay. Sure. It's D for DAB, M for Mother, C and D for DAB again. No, DAB. BNBOP. Okay, got it. That one I would confuse the best shirt. Okay, I got it. 1970 at hotmail.com. Correct. That is correct. Awesome. And the home address, what I have here, it's only on Perio. Can I give you the exact address please? 350-350 and it's Glen Meyer, G-L-E-N and the second word is M-E-Y-E-R, Road. And that is in Langston, Ontario. All right, thank you so much for that. So, um, up now for the online meet-em. I do have availability for. We can look into tomorrow at 2 p.m. or 6 p.m. What time do you prefer? Tomorrow at 6 would be better because I have to go to the doctor in the morning, like during the day. Sure.

As I put it in Korea on our Facebook ad for a heat pump. Oh yeah. How are you doing? Good how are you? What was that for the heat pump? Yeah it's for heat and that cool end like it does build heat and then cool end. The heat pump. Yeah I was just inquiring you know how much those are and you know and I have an old air conditioning unit right now and an old furnace so like it's 27 years old. Hello sure. First of all I just like to lay and know about some updates in the market like there used to be a rebate program which actually ended on January this year. However at the moment government is offering funds at their percent interest rate which means that if you qualify government will give you the money to get a heat pump installed in your home at their percent interest. Did you know about this before? No but I need to know if the heat pump would work with the existing system we have. Sure you said you have furnace at the moment right? Furnace and air conditioner. Yeah now when you get a heat pump then you only keep in your furnace at the back of heat system because you don't need to get rid of it as long as it's working good like if you have any complaints or it's broken then that's another case but if your furnace is working all good you keep it at the back up because the heat pump it has an outdoor unit which is going to be outside of your home and an indoor unit which gets connected to the furnace. Okay now as long as the air condition is concerned you don't need to you know you don't need the air condition when you have a heat pump for places that AC. How do I see? Yeah because it does like both coolant and heat in with the heat and it needs the back up so that's why you keep your furnace has the back up only for days when it's like very cold outside like the L-25-30 you know. Okay yeah. Okay I don't really know much about heat pumps so I'm going to have to inquire I have some friends in the business and I'll inquire with them before I make any kind of decisions even for you guys to come and have a look. Absolutely. So can you call me back in probably next week so I can make some inquiries about it? Absolutely I can definitely get back to you next week. And how much is it? Yes. Yeah like Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday is fine. Can you let me know approximately how much is the heat pump installed? Yeah honestly events I like work as an appointment booker so what we like what I do is I just like call clients and book you guys for an online meeting like we don't come to the place we do a virtual Google mate. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So why don't we set up a call for you to call me next week maybe next Monday or Tuesday would be fine. Okay and then I'll make some inquiries by then and then I'll have an answer.

I just called you. Yes, I know. I was, I missed the call. That's why I give you a call back. Are you going to talk now? I am. Um, where did you say you worked? Weaver? Weaver equal home. Weaver, yeah, and where is the head office base? Our head offices are located by Ferburemall. Here, let me give you the fact address. Isn't that Burlington Ferburemall? Ferburemall is North York, so Toronto. Well, there's a Ferburemall in Burlington, Ontario as well, which is west of Toronto. So you're, you're just east of Toronto, essentially, right? North York? Yes, northeast. Okay. Do you have any offices within the Hamilton area? That's where I'm located. We service Hamilton with no issue. Like last week alone, like we go all the way down to like we have done. I personally have done Windsor, Niagara. Yeah. Like to be honest, Hamilton is not even that far for us. That's not too bad. Well, yeah, depends on wood traffic, right? With time of day. 100% 100%. I used to, like a couple years ago, I actually used to work out of Burlington and that commute would kill me. I feel it. Right? One in the morning. It's only about an hour and a half. One in the afternoon. It's like four hours. I know. It is. And pray that there is no accidents, which happens every single week. That's shut down the entire traffic. There I go. I heard that my colleague, Yemen spoke with you a couple months ago. I would remember a couple of months ago. Gotcha. So you're looking at a standalone heat pump? Yes. Cold weather heat pumps, something that will be, I guess, 300 or 300, whatever the efficiency is, typically 300 to 400% efficient down at negative temperatures. And then I guess they'll still work at negative 30 if it's a cold weather heat pump. Yeah. So we're going to go to the way down to minus 30 at a high efficiency, which is pretty good. Like we carry two type of brands. We carry Bladex, which is our competitive like standard package. And we carry green or tauta for premium. They're both really good. They both have the same, almost same efficiency levels. And they both have the same temperature levels. The only main difference between the pricing is because one is known within Canada. It's more like a national brand, which is the Bladex. It agrees more known into national. That's why it's a little bit more because how big is your home? Well, I would be looking, my home is 1200 square feet. So the problem is for heating 1.5 to ton, perfect. But for cooling, I want like three times, right? Or vice versa, I apologize, vice versa. For cooling, 1.5 ton to ton is fantastic. But for heating, obviously you want bigger is better because for obvious reasons, efficiency, a three ton would be fantastic. And from what I understand, most all heat pumps these days are DC variable speeds, right? Yes. So then that would mean that a three ton could run at 30% and cool 1200 square foot without any problems, freezes up or anything like that, right? I mean, there's never an issue going up a bit bigger. I'm glad that you get it because most of our customers, they compare it to an AC only. So they always go smaller. For you in your case, honestly, two and a half to three is a sweet spot there. Like it's good. The main thing in this would be more like a technician question is making sure that the coil fits pretty much in your system to not damage it. That's all it is. But the difference between two and a half and three is not much to be honest. So I don't see the problem there like causing any issues to your home. So if that's really important. Yeah. Yeah, go ahead. Well, it's not like a three ton is way more expensive than two ton or I mean, they're all that's pretty much the same price. So that's that's that's the good news. So what I did know notice is LG was offering interestingly, you said blade X because I think that's midi, right? Medea media, yeah, they're manufactured by media. Yeah. I mean, from my research, over 80% of all heat pumps in the world are either gray or media. Yep. So, I mean, the technology has only come so far and it's not like one is better than the other in such a significant way that it makes a difference, right? No, it truly is not like all it is is like all this big brands like you know, this big manufacturers, they produce a lot and then different companies just love their brand in it. But at the end of the day, they're all very similar. Yeah. So the blade X has been around for three years and it was I think founded and was built in Markham. So it's like a more like a national brand. And from what I understand, there's a couple different models of the blade X. Yes, there's two. Yep. There's like one that's not cold leather and one that's cold leather essentially. Yeah, there's one that is minus 15 and the other one is minus 30. We did have the option of providing the minus 15 one, but we decided not to just because in the long run, it just gives headaches. It's going to kind of come back to us when people, you know, are complaining one thing and then complain. So we decided that it's not worth it just to sell like a cheaper heat pump, like a no cheaper, but like, you know, like lower price heat pump for to get more sales. We decided to just provide the blade X, the cold climate one minus 30 only. And then this is why I spoke to you about that because the LG home comfort offered 39, 99 installed and then they quoted me a blade X and then somebody else quoted me a blade X and they were much more money. And I was like, well, what's the difference? And then I had to actually get into the model number to confirm that it is in fact different, which you've just confirmed yet again, you know, two different models, same brand name. Yeah. So weeks ago, I had that scenario three times where I quoted somebody something and they were like, oh, I just got quoted from somebody I was like $1,500 less, $1,000 less, $1,500 less for the blade X. And I told them double check with them to make sure there's a sign model just because I know that blade X has two models and I send them to blade X website and ones that confirm it, they actually came back to us. So I'm glad that you actually look into it and got different opinions, you know. Yeah, I'm definitely doing my research on this. And I don't want to be stuck with a lemon because there's a number of people that I have heard from and know that they basically got screwed. You know, like you said, they expect one thing, but then it doesn't deliver. And they're like, what the hell? The biggest problem even back with the rebate is that a lot of people were promised that they were going to receive it and the equipment that they got installed, they're not even qualified for the rebate. So they're still waiting for their money and most likely, I'm not even going to receive it. That's just the same part about the industry. So yeah, the industry can definitely be shady. Aggressive. Yeah. Let's call it aggressive. Okay. We'll go with the politically correct term aggressive. So what I'm looking for me, so I ended up getting an LG, like I said, 35, 99 was for the heat pump that isn't really worth it in Canada. And then they went to 45, 99 for the other heat pump by BladeX, which was, I'm told, the negative 30. And they're saying that, and I looked it up, it seems to be that they're 350% efficient at negative seven. And then they drop off from there. And then they're 100% efficient at negative 30, which is just a heat strip that's installed. Yeah. Like what do you call it? Inductive heat, where they just heat up some heat strips. And it's just 100%, which is twice as much as gas at that point, right? Because gas is like 96% efficient. But cost-wise, gas is three times cheaper right now than electricity. Yeah, I'm following you. Yeah. So what I'm obviously, what's your, what's your install cost in Hamilton for a standalone BladeX, the negative 30, heat pump, with I guess everything installed, the ECOB thermostat or something like it, I think there's three different thermostats. That would provide us ECOBNNest. Right. We're going in smart. Yeah. Let me see if what you're looking for the three times you said, right? Yeah. And what's your, just to know how far you are, what's your address in Hamilton? I'm directly on the mountain. What the hell is the address here? L, he said, he said, uh, POSIKO. L-A-D-V-3-J2 is the specific. L-A-L-A-T-V-3-J2. And is that B for Victor or B for Bob? V-V-K. V-K, perfect. 3-J2. What? Let me get a view. So the LG Home Comfort was the 4599 and then it had the ECOB and then it, you know, included the line set, installation, the pad, where the outdoor unit would sit on or the stand. I mean, it had to be from Snowstand thing. Basically everything included. What? What type of offer warranty did it give you? Thank you. But one year. Service? 10 years labor. Oh, yeah. One year labor. 10 years. Right? One year labor. Yeah. One year labor. 10 years. And then, yeah, one year labor. And they did offer 10 years labor and I could pay that yearly for 2019, 1999, a month, 1990, 90 year, every year to extend the labor warranty. So it ended up for how many years? Up to 10 years for $20. Yeah. Yeah. To match the parts, labor warranty. But you had to pay extra. 19 years. And you had to pay it every year. Perfect. So that was key pump, the coil, you got the thermostat and the warranty. And how much you said they quoted you for? The Snowstand, the line sets, they're included all the things for 4599. And it was 3599 for the cheaper one. So $1,000. They're more than a thousand bucks. Yeah, a thousand bucks. Yeah. The best thing that I can do to my end is run it by my managers because to be open with you, our prices are a little bit more than that. What would be my price? For us right now, after taxes, our price is 5932. For the grand, yes, almost 6 grand, yeah. But I mean, we do have a best price policy, which means that, you know, since you already got a quote, do you got a writing or did he give you a call in writing or did he just said it? Just a text message. I'll have to copy the text message maybe. Hopefully it's still there. I have a racing messages. Let's see. 30, I can also call them back, right? 36, or sorry, 4600. There's almost something you have in AC right now, right? I currently have an AC. I have a six year old dike and it's two tonne and it's rated at seven, well, it says that it can do up to seared 24, but it's actually seared 17. So they kind of jiggy the number, right? Oh, maximum efficiency, seared 24, but the reality is 17. Yeah. Like in the best possible conditions, you will get seared 17, but, you know, generally speaking, seared 17 is what they do. That the model has got 17 in it as well. So you really have to dig in the paperwork or you get screwed. Spursually in the age back industry. Yeah, it really is, you know, aggressive. And it's perfect. So what I can do on my end is like, I can give you my email because I don't like wait, to be honest, that quote is pretty good. I don't want to waste your guys time. If I, if I could match it or beat it, it would be like 10%. Not just by a couple of, you know, like 20, 30, 50 bucks, because honestly, that would not be worth your time. If we do end up coming below of it, it will be 10% that we're going to beat it. I just personally cannot approve it right away. I would have to run it by my, but you know, the, the senior guys and the team. But yeah, if you can, I can give you my email. And if you can get me that in writing, I would forward it to them and give you a call back. So in fact, I'm just looking through my text messages now and they advertise it. They advertise both price, they advertise, yeah, they've, so I ended up getting, I ended up getting the quote from their advertisement from Facebook. And then I, I pushed the button like I did with you, right? And then put in my information and then somebody called me. And it was, it was the advertisement on Facebook. Apparently, they were saying, giving away heat pumps at a low cost because the government granted and basically all heat pump sales robs, like 80%. And they were just trying to get rid of stock is what the advertisement was. No, it is the rebate that ended in February, but they're coming back on June. Do you know what the rebate will be in June? The rebate on June is going to be a sort of Fisher yet, but they do have, I think they already approved it. The rebate will be, it's not going to be as much as before, but it's still a little bit of help is 250 per ton. So we're looking at for a three ton, you're looking at about 1500 that they're going to be able to cover. Wow. And it was 6000 before. Yeah, before they did. Yeah, before I got ridiculous though, went because the heat pumps were covering $6,000 of it. Some people double their prices just to make like a lot more money out of it. And I called the wholesaler down on Woodward Ave, the HVAC Holes. I'm a millerite by trade. So I'm a tradesman, so I get, I can buy anywhere, like I can buy at a plumbing store, I can buy HVAC equipment. And it was with, I think it was like $400 or $500 for the EVA. And then it was 2100 or 1900 depending on which one was like 2 grand. So in total, it was like 20, 20, 400 to 3200 for the equipment. And then to charge 6 grand, it's like you won't, you get 6 grand to come in and put in an EVA coil. And you know what I mean? So people were really raking money. So, and then I know that I've looked into LG Comfort home. And they were actually buying a high quantity of heat pumps so that they could get it at a much better price. They ended up paying like $1,200 for the condenser and you know $200 for the EVA. And I was like holy crap, they went all in and then the government went stupid and changed the rules. And then the average ended it in January and it was like holy shit, they got screwed. Now they're trying to get as many inventory as they can, no, make sense. That's why, yeah, it's for me, I try to do my homework and get the best product for the best price, right? Yeah. No, that's how it should be. Yeah. So, I kind of know what being paid for these things and usually I'm hoping that people work with me. At the end of the day, theoretically, the line sets already there, the EVA is already there. You know what I mean? Like, yeah. But in any case, it's not a lot of work to pull out the EVA. It's just that the trunk, right? And mine is easy access. And my line set is I think 8 feet. So, it makes life so much easier, everything's easy to get at. Probably be a two hour job. So to make, you know, if you send two guys which normally people do for an hour travel back and forth, half a day's work. You know what I mean? Yeah. Everybody's got to make money. No, they're being, if that's their price, to be honest, they're being very aggressive. That's a good, that's pretty good. I'm pretty sure it's because they bought a whole bunch. Yeah. To kind of like keep up with demand because I've been told by salesmen that the demand was really high near the end when they started to allow standalone heat pumps instead of buying whole systems. Yeah. So that's kind of what we're doing with air conditioners. We have a couple of them stock, but because people don't really look for them anymore, we're letting them go at a very low price. But the heat pump thing is people got to grow a little bit of love with after the government of the rebate because the demand came down. Even us, we have to adjust our approach. I see that pretty well with the heat pumps because of the other face, it makes sense for people. But it definitely saw the volume going down versus before, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I definitely understand. Now, just so that we're clear and I want to tell you this piece of information, I got my home assessment. I've booked it the day before it closed, the deal closed, the day before Enbridge shut it shut down. Okay. I got it the day before. I've got the appointment the day before and then January 20th, it was end of January. I ended up getting the home evaluation and I'm locked in until 2027 for the rebate. Oh, so you get that rebate. I've decided to, because I saw, I thought coming, I decided to, I decided to hold off regardless of what salesmen were telling me get it now. Get it now. Before it's gone, I'm like, didn't know, no, no, no, it's going to be gone. Enbridge is going to be stuck with heat pump and they're going to want to clear them out. So I'm going to get it for a lot cheaper. And that's why it's in my best interest to have waited. And whatever it is, I get full six grand credit, but I want to, I want to cash back. Like you can buy my old air conditioner for X amount of dollars or some, however you want to work it on your book. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's, that's what I, and I know this business is aggressive. That was the right word, wasn't it? There it was. So I know, I know that's, I know that's totally doable for the cash back. So you give me a receipt for the six grand and I pay, you know, whatever, the 45 plus the tax or whatever it was, which is like five grand, 5100 or something like that, right? So, you know, it was before tax. The 40, the 4599 was before tax. Yeah, so 5100 after tax, which would have, would give me about which gives me eight hundred dollars cash back. Plus, I get to recoup the money for the actual assessment, which in order to get an assessment as quick as I did, because I knew it was going to never, going to start up again. I ended up paying, I think it was 900 or it was a hundred dollars more than they gave you cash, cash for. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, because the use of Cobra, I think it was like 600 and the Audit R750. Yeah, I ended up in 100 something like that. I think I ended up paying like 8800 or I think it was 800 then. It must have been around 800. It probably was around the 800, because that's how much it is after taxes for us. Because at the end of the day, I needed that audit right away. They were saying after they shut it down mid-January, they were saying, oh, you'll have till end of February to get it done. You're assessment, I'm like, can't bullshit. So I ended up getting it done as soon as possible. It paid an extra hundred bucks for that. And lo and behold, it was every second done. It was like, a bitch, he fucking government. Endbridge screwed a lot of people on that one. The government screwed Endbridge and an endbridge screwed everybody else. That's true. So what I can do is I can ask them those two questions. One, if we can match that price or beat it. And number two, if we do have that option of the cash back. Yeah, or buy my old air conditioner for a thousand bucks or something like that. That looks a normal on paperwork. We might not do that just because we provide new equipment. We don't do use. We're sure that they probably won't do that. But I can, I mean, we can just still dispose of for you. If it's too old, if you still want to keep it in sale, if somebody else, you could definitely do that. But I can check with them and ask them those two questions and get back to you within 30 minutes. Because what was your timeline to get this done? If you had everything good to go, I'm ready to do it pretty much any time. Perfect. And will you be handling that out? Do you have the information or whoever they they're out of for you? Of course, yeah. Okay, that was good. Because what you can do is either on your own or my team can contact them as well. So after it gets installed, they can do the second one. And then you can receive that grant. I think it comes ten days after. It's pretty quick. It's not too bad. So I think it's a great way to get the grant out of your way minimum. And the grant, so first of all, I'm going to be doing some insulation on the roof. I'm doing my roof as well. And I'm going to get the, that basically tops it up to the ten grant that you're allowed through the rebate. And so once I do the roof, then I'll have the audit guy come. He'll go ahead and approve all those two things. So they send it to the government. I might have half the audit people, the company. And the wait time is the last I heard was a year before the government gives you to get the grant. Yeah, like to be given the money is a year. So yeah, that's significant. And yeah, I've also applied for that $45,000 interest tree loan for ten years. And I've been approved for that. So I'm taking advantage of everything the government has to offer right now. I mean, why not? It's free money. I mean, well, it's definitely, it's good to have $45,000. You have to get approved and you have to, we had to jump a bunch of hoops to do it. Like it's not easy. And you know, you got to, you got to be aggressive when you, when you're dealing with that sort of thing. You got both. You got the grant and the loan. That's pretty good. Yeah, they give you the loan as long as you can prove that what you're going to do for it and then give receipts for the stuff that you've spent. Yeah, they give you the, so hey, no problem. You know what I mean? I'll take advantage of it. I'll definitely use it because no interest on $45,000 for ten years. Okay, I'll, I'll, I'll take your $45,000 for, you know, for free, for, for ten years. The only problem is they attach it to your house. They put a lien on your home. So if you want to sell the house, you got to pay off the, the grant. The government puts the lien on the home through the CRA. But you never see it on your title, they said. It's just through the CRA, they put the lien. Anyway, yeah, get back to me. Let me know. I anticipate spending in total once the government extortion fees are kicked in and everything around $5,000. So I'm looking for a $6,000 receipt and paying you five grand. That would, that would be what I'm looking for with the Belaydex negative 30. Full receipts when you get here to install the things before you start disconnecting the aid. And you're disconnecting the ASEAN and doing the work full receipt before like when you show up with all the equipment ready to go. Yeah, I definitely don't want, I definitely don't want the air conditioner uninstalled and the system drained. And then you guys say, oh, sorry, we can't give you that. You know what I'm saying? Of course. Let me check. Let me send you my email through text. What else was there? Yeah, I missed that in everything's installed one year warranty. Yeah, warranty on labor. That's like, oh, I think I just got your text. Just heard a text. Come in. I just send you my email. Let me talk to my manager about the price and then let me get back to you. Sounds good. Sounds good. Talk to you soon. Yep.

Perfect. So you said that you don't have a chance to join the meeting. Right? You just wanted to talk over the phone. Sorry. What was that? Perfect. Do you receive the link for the meeting or no? No. Is there something to show? Usually we show everything. But I mean at the end of the day, what was the main goal for the heat pump? Because I'm seeing here the notes. And it looks like your AC is broken at the moment. Yeah, he's not working properly. So I need to place it. My fitness is about four years old. And it's high efficiency, multi-stage, variable speed. So that's fine. It's just the AC. So I'm actually looking at the option of heat pump. What does it say? So the thing is there are no rebates. So they're here, right? And the same change. The rebates are not. They're not. They got rid of them in February. So it's been the rebate's been offered a little bit now. Yeah. So that's gone. I didn't that. What would you suggest? Heat pump was the AC for here. Me personally in the long run. I feel like the heat pump is more worth it. Just because at the beginning, yeah, it might cost you a little bit more. But in the long run, like, you know, even though your furnace is still high, efficiency is still relies on gas. Yeah, the gas is cheaper. Gas, it depends, right? Because sometimes like gas, for example, with the carbon tax inflation, everything, I have seen people like bills going, keep getting higher and higher every year. So based on how much you're spending on gas and everything, the savings that we have here that you were expected to get is about 105. I mean, at the end of the day, the heat pump at the AC is going to raise your electricity cost like regardless of it. Both of them are going to do that. Right. Heat pump is going to raise it slightly more than the AC, but it's going to save you a lot more on gas. Yeah, this is an offset that the argument that I hear is going to save. But the thing is with the extreme ventures, the way heat pump is going to use the electricity, it's not, I don't know if it's really a bird, he's saving the nap, and electricity is more expensive. So the argument goes both ways, maybe a little bit, but what I was trying to get, because if you have longer summers, by all means, I think heat pump, that's what I read about it. And correct if I'm mistaken here. But if you have like few months of summer, then it's good, because they are more efficient than the actual ACs. And with the very mild winter, they can do the job that's great. Then you don't need to, like for this, and the AC. But here we have a short summer, maximum of three months of ACs. And that's where it is. Okay. So AC versus heat pump, both the pi-steffants. I mean, if they pi-steffants not much, then yeah, by all means, they're better. But if the pi-steffants is huge, then I've done something that I have to decide. I mean, yeah, for instance, it's really new, it's two, three months, three months of summer, that we really need the AC. How much difference is it going to make? You know all that, because both pi-steffants increase, electricity increases every year, too. And so does the gas. You know, and some as such, it's just a calculation how you use it. So that's what it is. But what's the difference? That's what I was trying to get to the understanding of the pricing. Because of your home, because you're at 3,500 square footage, what size have you been getting for the heat pump? Because I have you here between a three and a half and a five ton. Right. So basically, I've been getting clean and I have four. My current AC is 10 and a half ton carrier. And that was doing fine job, but four ton would do. For the heat pump, I was being told four pumps would be better. At least, you know, four pumps. 10 and a half is a little, you know, it can do the job, but four ton would be better. Yes, it definitely will. Here, let me just take a look. So the price that I have, yeah, go ahead. No, no, go ahead. No, I was going to say because I do have the price of the heat pump in front of me. The AC, we do have someone stock, but we haven't done AC in a long time. So I would have to get the price of those. I'm sure my guy probably wants to get rid of them. So he will probably give a good deal for us. So I would have to get more details in those so I can give you a call back or send you an email with the both of them. When it comes to the heat pump, the heat pump that I have here for you. The price is a 60, 200 after tax, so 6, 271. That's what the heat pump, the coil, the thermostat, the warranty, and full installation. So that's the full cause of it. Okay. Okay. That's really high. Which one is it? Is the blade X? Blade X. Okay. Oh. Okay. I'll leave it to that for blade X. That's by midi, midi, whatever it's called, company. Blade X is manufactured by media, which media manufacturers like a larger model of the pump. How long has been blade X in the business? Three years, they're actually a Canadian company, funded in Markham. They have done extremely well, but the reason why the price is a little bit less than the toss-ups, the grease, the mischievous. The price is because they're only known in pretty much national wide within Canada. The older brands are more known internationally, that's why the older ones cost a bit more. But blade X has done extremely well, and all the units that we carry is their old coal climates, which they go down to minus 30. Okay. Let's check the AC price, because the price of the AC and this is quite a bit of difference. That way, I think I've seen. It's a significant difference. So I may have to... Let's check the price of the AC. Let's say this way. Let me give me a minute. If I can now get a move from the next minute, I'll let you know when I send it to you in the email, or you'll buy it. Give me one sec. Yeah, text me, even if you send me new women, text me as well, because I need to make it this evening. Say, I'll go into the next direction, I'm going to go to, if it may. I'll move over a bit. So once you get it, this text me. I'll take the email, even if it's in the email, that's fine, but this text me. No problem, we call you back in two minutes. Bye bye.

No, no, no, it's not heat. I can put... No, no, no. You need to put it on air condition. Yes. Okay. If you turn it off, then no, your air condition is not going to work because you've turned it off. So it's okay if I put 70 and turn on air condition. Well, it depends on... Okay, so just give me a moment because... So 70... You're in Fahrenheit 70. Fahrenheit to Celsius. So you wanted at 21. 21 is cool to have it in the house. That way you want... I don't want that to cool. Okay, because that's 20. So if you had it at 70... Okay, wait a minute. All right. I'll see you. So how much should I put? I will tell you in a second. I'm just looking this up for you, okay? Okay. Okay. So you should have it at says... Okay, you're Fahrenheit. It says you should be at 78 degrees Fahrenheit. I should put 78. That's what it's showing me. Okay. I'm going to put it right now. So I'm going to put it right now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put it right now. 78. Yes. And put air conditioning on. Yes. Okay. And what does... Is your air conditioning on? No. Because... Because it was too cool. I don't know what to do. I put... Okay, but now you've turned on the air condition, right? If you go to your vent, is there cool air coming out of it? Like, is your air conditioning... What's the air conditioning on? Wait. Wait. I... I'm going to put it right now. Okay. I put it on. Wait. I... I... I'm going to put it on. Wait. Wait. Wait. I... I... Okay. I put it on... I'm going to put it on. Okay. How much is it, is it... Is it... Is it... Is it... Is it... cold okay? No that's what I mean okay you just wanted at a nice temperature right? Yes yes. Okay let me put you on hold and I'll let you know exactly which temperature okay? Okay thank you. Hello? Hello? Okay so I just spoke to my technician 70s gonna make it very cold in your house. You should put it anywhere from 75 to 76. See how that is? If you want it warmer go to 77 but see how it goes put it at 75 76 right now give it a few hours and see how you like it. 75 or 76? Yes then after a couple hours if you find it's still cold go a little bit higher but that's how you know you're you're right right yes go to 76 see how you like it if it's too cold to go up a little higher if it's too warm go down one. So now I put too more but then stay still show us 74. It's gonna show us 74 because you got to wait till the house gets to that. So I put in a 76 and and and nothing else. No leave it at that. Okay it's showing 74 because that's what the house is at right now. Once one six hits 76 it'll show 76. See how you like it if it's too cold you're gonna go up if it's too warm you're gonna go down. So there's nothing wrong with your AC you just have to put it at the right setting. 70 would have been too cold for you. So there's nothing wrong with the AC it's just your adjustment. So if it's too cold no one on the top button I should put right. No if it's too cold you're gonna go up one if right it's too warm you go down. Oh too warm to go down. No if it's too cold you're gonna go down if it's too warm you're gonna go up. But normal temperature a normal temperature for a home is anywhere from 75 and 76. Okay can you I'm gonna put that on paper that I will make me sick. Yeah no no that's okay you could even call us that's no problem but at 70 you're too cold okay that's why. You know now now now repeat those bottom up and now. Okay okay so you're gonna go put your thermostat at 75. So there is two buttons if it's too cold, pretend it's too cold push bottom button or up button. Hey just give me one second. I put my paper then then I'm more. Yes okay so for a normal house he said you have to go 75 or 76. Yeah but if for some reason for me to pretend to call which button I should put the bottom or up. Okay so okay so if it's too cold you're gonna go up if it's too warm you're gonna go down. So air condition is opposite from heat. So if it's too cold you're gonna go up if it's too warm you're gonna go down. That's why I said put it 75, 76 but maybe put it at 75 okay. Okay because you want it warmer right? So put it at 75 see how it is if it's too cold go to 74 then and then go slowly to see how you like it. So you want me to know put the 75. Yes believe it at 75 give it a couple hours and see how you like it. If it's too cold go down if it's too warm go up. Too warm. I did opposite interaction. I put the top button to call and then bottom to warm. Yes. Yes. Okay so right now leave it at 75. Okay I'll see how you like it. If it seems fine leave it at that okay. So you kind of have to play with it a little bit until you see how you like it. I don't know put it now. I put it in a couple minutes ago I put it in a seven. Yes. You got to give it at least a half hour to an hour to notice a difference. Now I have to take one number you said 75 yeah go to 75. Touch bottom bottom bottom. Yes. Okay and see how you like it in a couple hours if it's too cold. Okay but the house guts to get to that temperature now right you got to wait till it gets to that temperature. Yeah. Okay so give it a couple hours see how you feel it's it feels right you leave it if not then you make the adjustment slowly. Okay there's cold air coming out of your vent now. Yeah no I don't know I go check. Yeah go check and see if you got cold air coming out of your vent. Yeah. That means your conditions working you just have to adjust it properly for your liking. Yeah probably. Yeah. Okay so give it a couple hours leave it right. Leave it now do not touch it in a couple hours if it's too cold then you touch it just by one degree if it's not leave it. So if it's too cold what should I do up? You're going to have to adjust it. Now how much? If it's too cold you go up by one just by one always do it by one until you get it to how you like it. But top bottom right? Yes. Okay okay in a couple hours if you have any problems give us a call and we'll help you okay? Yeah okay. I'll be better if there's somebody. No one's going to come to your home to adjust your temperature there's a charge for that because there's nothing wrong with your unit. Do you have cold air coming out of the vent? Yeah. There you go your air conditions working you just got to put it on how you like it. So now what you tell me I put is it's correct? Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. If it's too cold give us a call we'll tell you what to do. But there's nothing wrong with your air see AC. If there's something wrong with the air condition then we'll send a technician out. There's nothing wrong you get charged for them to come and just to change the degrees for you. Yeah I know I know but it's too cool you can It's too cold Zorika you have to adjust your temperature does that does not mean there's something wrong with the AC it means you have to adjust your temperature. If it's I'm going to ask you one more time sorry. No that's okay. If it's too cool push a top bottom for one more. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. And then if it's and then it's because see what happens Zorika if I send a technician out just to adjust your temperature there is a service fee charge. So when you had it on yesterday you had it on too high so that meant that your house was really cold that's why you turned it off. So there's nothing wrong with the AC it's just your temperature was not to your liking. So give it a couple hours see how it feels if you're having if you find it's too cold and you can't remember how to do it give for me a call back and I will guide you on how to do it okay. I did before I did before I did the introduction now with you I'm going to check one more time. Yeah so go to your vent and you'll see that that yeah is there cold air coming out? If it's too cold push a top bottom right? Correct. If one one one one up. Correct. If it's uh uh uh one one complain if it's too warm. No. Yes. Okay. So see how it goes in a couple hours Zorika. See how it goes in a couple hours if you find it's too cold give me a call back and I will tell you what to do okay. Okay I will I will I will absolutely but there is cold air coming out of your vent right now correct? Yes. Right so that means your air conditions working it's just you're not putting the temperature on how you like it you want it a little bit warmer than cooler so you had it too cool last night that's why. Uh huh. Okay. Okay perfect if you have trouble in a couple hours you give me a call. But what should I do if I if I want to get rid of it still too cool we should I put off. Okay but if you don't want your air condition on at all and you don't want your furnace then you leave your system on off. Like you said you wanted your AC on but it was too cold last night so you had to turn it off and you thought because it was too cold you thought there's something wrong with your unit but there isn't if you have to adjust your thermostat to the temperature of your liking. Okay last night when I put when I I don't know what what else to do you know I'm not. Yeah no no absolutely so I spoke to my technician and my technician. Yeah go ahead. I put last night I put now heat and stop automatically stop. Of course it's going to stop. Turn your furnace on to heat you're now going to get heat right? Yeah right when you have your eighth right but you don't want to like if you want your AC on and it's just too high you have to adjust the temperature to your liking. So the normal okay I should put just one up. No nothing got this one. Correct. Correct but if you turn your furnace on your AC is not going to work because you got your furnace on. I know I know I know it's a little yeah okay so leave it at that 75 right now give it a couple hours to see how you like it if you want it warmer give me a call and I will guide you okay. One minute so I I I put myself in a six that right. Right so a normal home I spoke to the technician then you normally have it at 75 or 76. I told you to leave it at 75 give it two hours see how you like that temperature okay. So that's what show me over there for second when I'm setting is a show and I lose that number. That's fine because until it gets to temperature it's not going to show you once it's 75 it's going to show you. So give it two hours okay it's 11 o'clock at 1 yeah yeah. See how you like it if you don't like it because it's too tall give it a call. I hardly hear you. I'm sorry. Say that again. I hardly hear you. I said give it to one o'clock and see how you like the temperature if you like it you leave it like that. If you don't like it that you want it warmer give it a call and we'll tell you what to do again okay. Okay so you don't have to write it down because it seems like it's confusing you just give me a call and I will tell you what temperature to put it out okay. Perfect. No sure. Yes that's what I mean because now that's what your temperature is in your home right? Yeah. Okay perfect. So see how it goes for a couple hours if it's too cold give me a call okay? Okay okay perfect okay. Okay perfect thank you. Okay you're so welcome have a good day bye bye.",1335.389886621315,-6.174806912895292e-06,0.9535275101661682,-0.9950425624847412,0.09173043817281723,778.7146938775509,0.180518426842684,0.5741457121902667

Okay. Yeah. Okay. Did you get the email I sent now? No, yeah. Or you could go to any reminder that you have not clicked on yet. Well, it's that helps. Yeah.

That's the one I'm in, I think. Perfect. So does it say sign in? It says get started. Get started. Excellent. So get into that. Okay. And I will ask you for a password to sign in. Okay. Oh, damn, I can't remember what I did. Oh. You did 350, David. That's right. No space and uppercase D. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So on that one there where it says doesn't match. Can you press reset password or redo password? Just forgot password. Forgot password. Excellent. Can you click that? We're just going to go step by step from that email. Okay. I'm in there. So I just want to get an email? Yep. So what does it say when you send that? Does it say check your email? Nope. Okay. So if you press forgot, reset password, what does it say? Just forgot password. So that means they want me to put a new password in, right? But there's no space here to do it. Okay. But you have to click forgot password so they can send you a link, right? I did. Yeah. Okay. So now you're going to get out of there and go to the new email where it says reset password. Okay. You can't do it right there. So you have to go to the new email that got sent. Ah, reset password. Okay. Okay. So now let's do that. Reset password. Yep. Excellent. Now reset it to... If you want to use like... If you could do 350, David's in and then street. You know what I mean?

I thought you put an inquiry on a Facebook ad for a hip-hop. Yeah, I was just curious. No, I was going to get to that accidentally. Sort of an accident that it hit the button, but anyway, I was kind of curious to know a $5,000 rebate on how much the heat pump actually costs. Yeah, now, as long as the cost is concerned, it ranges anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000. That's the price. However, the rebate, Klaaren, there used to be a rebate program which actually ended on January this year. So there is no more rebate available. So that again? There is no more rebate. The rebate ends on January this year. Okay, so the $5,000, you can get up to $5,000 off. The heat pump unit is not accurate because it's not up to date, obviously. I'm not sure there is another incentive program, but that one you can qualify for up to $40,000. But that's like an interest-free funding program, like a loan which is interest-free. So you can qualify for up to $40,000. Okay, okay. That's fine. Yeah, okay. So like I said, I must understand what I read. Okay, that's fine. Oh, I see. I was going to do a job and a rich guy asked by the way or no. No, I don't. I'm not even in Toronto. I'm going to do a people away. Oh, I see. Anyway, yeah, I know that. All right, so, all right.

No, he's not home at the moment. Would I be able to take a message? Actually, ma'am, I'm just calling to confirm the appointment that was booked, which is for tomorrow between 10 to 11 a.m. and the morning. Okay, I'm his daughter and I'm, he's not here at the moment. He went out with a friend. But what is the, what is the appointment for? Yes, ma'am. It's actually a complimentary of free appointment for the qualification of free heat, one through the federal government and also qualification of the programs to start saving on energy and utility bills. I mean, the weather is completely free. Okay, but this is like, is this a Christmas, like 86 years old and he doesn't, I'm not home often. I'm like, he does this stuff and people come and say this complimentary stuff, it's for this, isn't it? And then he's been paying for like some water heater or something for a tank for 20 years now, been on his, on his bill. And like, so what is this really like what is this for really rebate from the government or what is it? Or you're going to try and show us the service and give us a product and put it in and we're going to have to rent up something from you guys. No, ma'am, actually, I really understand your concern, but as a matter of fact, most of our customers are not aware of this new program that the government started after this. So I started after this job, the $10,000 rebate and this helps homeowners qualify for a free heat pump and also save on their energy bills as I told you the energy advisor will just come over and will give all the details and information about the programs. It all depends on the homeowners whether they want to go for it, they want to qualify themselves or not. I mean, it's all up on their decision. I can't speak. I'm not the homeowner and I don't think you guys should come over tomorrow because you guys want to call back tomorrow or later on this evening and speak with him. He's just with a friend, but you guys could talk to him, but when he doesn't make that appointment, I'll make sure I'm around for it because he's had this stuff happen before and it's been a rip off and it's he's spent thousands and thousands of dollars. I don't know about what this program is for rebate blah blah blah blah. He's okay without it. So like she'll survive without it if it was something to do with government and it was legit. Then it would have been, she probably would have known about it already. So I don't know, but you can call back later on, but I wouldn't make, I wouldn't send anybody over tomorrow because he, I don't know if he's concerned with you guys or not, but if it is anything like. It was confirmed, like it was booked with him by one of our agents, so that's why I have the address, the timings I just wanted to confirm it. So that's why I mean, if you are it's okay, I mean, you can also be available while meeting so you can have him. I mean, you can sit there. But like this, honestly, like, where are you calling from? What program are you guys? If you're not calling from the government, so what are you? Are you guys like, what company are you calling from? And what is it to do? You guys are going to install something in here or give us something. So we put it in, we send certain amount of money and then we get a $10,000 rebate. I know about the stuff already. So what is it exactly that your guy is coming to talk to him about? And what is the company that they're coming from? I'm calling you from Canadian Choice Home Services and we are licensed dealers with Enbridge and we help homeowners qualify for programs from the government. Okay, so like that end, okay, so you're sorry, can I write this down? You guys you're calling from what? Where? I'm calling from Canadian Choice Home Services. Canadian Choice Home Services, right? Yes, ma'am. Okay, if you guys want to call back, he should be home within a, maybe I don't know, he's out with his friend. He usually comes back around like, they should be back about within an hour and a half. If you guys want to call back to confirm with him, since you guys already made that appointment, that's fine. So you guys can call back and I will look up the information. So when you guys do call back and when he gets home, I'll know a little bit more information about you guys. Okay, sure no problem. Okay, we will, I mean, try calling back after one and a half hours to come. Yeah, but one, he should be back within an hour and an hour and a half. He's with his friend. It depends what time. His friend, he goes out to have dinner with his friend every Tuesday, so they just run out to have dinner. So he should be back within an hour and a half. I can't guarantee, but I would say an hour and a half. Okay, no problem. We will try calling back. Okay, thank you. Thank you.

Colony, regards to your first meeting about a heat bump. Yeah, sorry, it's a government giving away. Are they giving like rebate back? So not really. The rebate program it ended on January 16th. But for homeowners, homeless out on the rebate, government has extended a limited time interest free funding program. So they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat bump and sold in your home at their person interest rate. And you give the interest free money for a period of 10 years. This is the current program. And how do you qualify for that? The criteria is like the first you have to you have to be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. It shouldn't be a new bill because new bills houses do not qualify. The house should be at least six months old. Okay. And it shouldn't be a condo or a apartment because once again, they don't qualify. It has to be a house. Okay. And you should be a peer holder or a Canadian citizen with a fair credit score. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And like do you have to meet a certain like income criteria? No. No. It's not based on income now. Okay. And roughly how much would a heat pump cost? Well, I looked at last year and they were fairly expensive. Oh, yeah. They were actually expensive last year because of the rebate. That's basically one of the reasons they took away the rebate because people were kind of like code and much more because there was a rebate of 7,000 plus, right? So right. But at the moment, the price is like I might feel work as an appointment booker. I cannot provide you with the exact price. But if it if I could give you a range, that would be anywhere from a $4,000 to $6,000. Somewhere in. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And sorry. Go ahead.

I saw you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. Just a call into laying out some updates in the market. Okay. The next question is, Rebay program, it has transition and the government is now offering funds at a 0% interest rate. Did you know about this before? The 0% is a death degree and for 40,000, right? Yes, exactly. Okay, perfect. You know about it. Yes. So show up. What I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors. She'll provide it with our prize and the product that we offer for a heat bump. Okay. Okay. So we're really confused. It's a Weaver like W-A-E-A-V-E-R. Okay. Weaver. And that's for the, I was actually running for the heat bump, but do you have the, so that program is meant for a heat bump or just, it's not just for, it's a heat bump, right? The loan? Yes. It's basically for different upgrades. It could be hidden and cool and the heat bump, the water heater or the air sealant. So it can actually include multiple upgrades to the house. What are you looking at too spasically? I actually am looking mainly, I need to replace the AC. So I could go for the heat bump, but I know the other program they had for the heat bump is no longer there. Reba? Yeah, the Reba is gone, so this one is more for loan, but, yeah, we can test. Does it apply for the AC too? It's not really. It doesn't apply for AC. It's just for heat bump because it's kind of like more efficient than AC. That's why it's only for heat bump. What we can do is, you can see, let me see one thing, do you have in-brush gas or are you in-brush clients? Or no. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So what we can do is, as I said, you can get a coat for the heat pump and you can discuss this interest free program as well. I know as you say that it's a loan but it's interest free, right? And you have a period of ten years. Plus, you have to do an energy audit for like a home instruction for this program which you can actually use for any incentive, if it's any incentive is not or anything, you can actually apply for that one as well with the same audit. So, okay. So I did can be done for anything. Like, you know, you need to put anything and, yeah. Okay. I'm full of ease, the maximum amount, the gear print. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what to do? Do you want to get a coat for a heat pump? Sure. I can do that. Yeah. All right. Tell me a bit about your home lake when was your house built? It's 20 years old. And it's a hungler at your storey. It's a two storey. And what's the house size and it's quite a feed like roughly? It's a $500. Okay. And do you have a gas furnace? Right? Yes. And it's the same age as the house like almost 20 years? So what? Certainly it's no furnace. It's new. 40 years old. 40 years? Okay. Very good. And this is your primary residence and your homeowner cracked? Yes. And what's the average monthly electricity bill just a rough idea? Around 20. Average. And then 10. I put about an average gas bill. About 130 or 140 on average. Okay. The email address is just a confirm its show at hotmail.com. Is that correct? Yes. And the home address what I have here is only on per year. Can I get the exact address? 172 vintage gate. Memptop. Okay. Okay. So if you can send me an email because I have to go. Absolutely. Just a few more seconds. I can like as I said, I'm going to schedule you for an online meeting with the advisor. It's virtual online. Now I do have availability for tomorrow at 1 p.m. 2 p.m. 4 and 5. What time do you prefer? Do you have anything for later today? Not really. Okay. So for tomorrow you said 1 or 2. Is it due to? One p.m. One p.m. Yeah. One p.m. It's fine. Okay.

The wind at the time when it's a heater is, it's early going to, there's under a 15 or 16 degrees going to work on a heat pump on the everything basis, right? Yeah. The only going to, my gas pump is going to work when it's really cold. So when it's working, actually, I can say money on both the wind and the summer, even for the AC going to work on the energy assistance, right? Okay. Yeah. What's great about our heat pumps is that they're very energy efficient. We have, we offer cold climate heat pumps. So they're actually very energy efficient up until minus 25. And then up to minus 30, the efficiency goes down, but then when it's pushed past minus 30, then automatically you, the furnace would kick in and then you would just go from there. You say the minus 30 or is it the key? The furnace, the furnace, when it's going to start working the minus 30, is there right? No, it's, it's very efficient up until minus 30. So it's very efficient heating up until minus 30. But then once it pushes past, then it becomes the last efficient. And that's when the furnace would automatically kick in. Yeah. Okay. And have you done any energy efficient upgrades in the past? Nothing. No, nothing. I was going to do it before the later goal. We remember that they had a repeat was offering before much. I think for a rehearsal. Then I missed that. Yeah. I was talking to somebody, then I never can start to get somebody to come over and come here all the way there. So, Ruben, your time is actually perfect because in the previous rebate program, they asked the government got a little overwhelmed and they weren't able to pay everyone out. Or if they did, they paid them out like nine months to a year. So they ended it in February and they decided to just take a break to restructure and they're bringing back that restructure program in June. That was a pretty might day cover ever. It's only you waiting time is so long ago, but other than that, they pay everything, I guess, right? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, that's exactly it. And so throughout this, throughout this presentation, it's going to introduce who we are, what our full package includes and warranties and financing and all that fun stuff. So we were going home, we've been around for 15 years, and we've done thousands of installations across Ontario, BC, and Alberta. But over the last few years, we've kind of noticed a problem in the HVAC industry. Basically, the customer experience wasn't really taken into consideration. So what we did to combat this is we're doing our meetings virtually. And instead of like sending someone to your door to do a high pressure sales tactics, we just treat this more as informal education discussion. And another thing we do is that we have a very strict quality control process in place. So when we install it, when we do the whole all the paper work, get your rebate done, we don't just go to afterwards, we always ask for your feedback and your feedback is important, including this meeting that we're having and the technicians, everything. We always want to make sure that our services is at the top that it can be. So I just want to confirm, do you live at 70 Apple Valley Way Brampton, Ontario? I'm sorry. And you're, size of your house is 3000 square feet. Yeah. Year of home is 2013. 22. Okay. And average electricity and gas is 125 and 188. 180. Yeah, average. I just never, you know, he's looking at all that we're on. When is the wind the time the gas bill more than the electricity bill low on the. Yeah, like this is high and that has a bill. No, of course, of course. Yeah, have you heard about what's going on with the carbon tax? Yeah, it's going higher. Yeah, it's going higher. So the government of Canada has been very transparent in that they're planning on increasing the carbon tax and increasing the cost of fuel every year up until 2030. So that's going to affect you when you're on gas, oil, propane, any form of fossil fuel. And that's also why they're doing these rebate and loan programs so that they're able to incentivize people to switch and pay less in carbon tax. So I'm going to go into more specific details with you, but on average, the home and Ontario, average home and Ontario loses about $250 a month on their heating and cooling towards utilities, which equals to about $15,000 last over five years. When you have a heat pump installed, you save on average $150 a month or 1800 a year just on your gas bills alone and that's not including the electricity savings. That's only the gas and plus the electricity also is going to help. Yeah, it's very energy, very energy efficient. The reason why it's energy efficient is that the power that it draws, it doesn't draw that much from it. Right compared to like a standard AC and a standard furnace that is going to be a same quality, what we get through that the regular or 80 and the other. That work. Absolutely not only is it going to be the same quality, but it's actually going to be better quality. It has because they have a very coil inside it produces even heating cooling throughout the entire house. So you're never going to experience any hot or cold spots and also on top of that a heat pump lasts on average between 20 to 25 years. Whereas a furnace and AC, they tend to start breaking down around 10 to 15 years and then you have to do maintenance and repairs and all that. There is no maintenance with with a heat pump. The only maintenance is very minor is that you change the filter every couple years, but I mean, you I feel like you're your capable guys so you can probably change the filter, no problem. So do you have an understanding of how heat pumps work? Not really. Never. You know, not really. Okay. It's the easy work that the full look keyed out and the wintertime other work out that we're on. Full look keyed in. So almost so you're you're almost there. So I'm not going to bore you with the tentacles, but pretty much uses the last thermal dynamics to create a heat exchange. So takes so in the wintertime it takes the cool air from the house, sends it out takes the outside air and that outside air goes through goes through coil that brings that warm air inside. So you're pretty much just cycling the air that's inside and outside and and heating it up in the winter and in the summertime. It does the exact same process, but just the opposite way. But it's going to support the H back. I was all because I have a way H back in the winter time. I get a lot of moisture on the window, right? Because I had run my H back throughout the year. But since it's going to bring the outside air in and it's going to help in the both ways. Sorry, sorry. I'm not full. I'm not sure if I fully understand you there. You know, it's fast. I have it in the house. Yeah. So in the winter time, what I noticed I have a lot of moisture on the window, because I think normally there was so much cold. Water or sitting around the window and moisture around the window and window cut damage. If this is going to help anyway to get that window swearing. So the reason that is happening and this is just what gas is that what I'm guessing is that is that is that the air that's coming in your current for furnace. It's leaking out and it's creating that moisture. There's not going to be when you have a heat pump. There's not going to be really any risk of leakage whatsoever. And when you get the energy audit done, they're going to tell you they're going to give you recommendations on the upgrades to do. And they might say that to do some ceiling, which we also offer that as a service. But that will be a conversation for another day though. So I'm going to go through the full hybrid heat pump package. So the first component of the package is the outdoor unit to co-climate how heat pump out their unit. As I mentioned, it gives you comfortable cooling and heating from as low as minus 20 to minus 30. Once it pushes past minus 30, then your backup furnace would kick in. And the great thing about it in the song is one of my favorite parts is that it's not noisy at all. So you're not going to have like some giant furnace that's creating all this noise all the time. And I think a huge advantage to with a heat pump is really safety because with the with the with the gas furnace. If there's any form of crack whatsoever, you risk getting carbon monoxide. You risk the gas leak because a heat pump doesn't use any gas at all uses hydro, which is, which is like electricity and water. But I'm not geared up the gas furnace. They're still going to be there only is going to work when necessary to run the gas furnace. So I want to have it right? Yeah, of course, you're still going to have the gas furnace for sure, but you're you're usage of the gas furnace is going to be up to a minimum. It's only going to be on those very like emergency cold days. So you're so this will actually make your gas furnace last a lot longer because you're not using it as much, right? All right. Yeah, so inside this is pretty much what I consider the brain of the heat pump is the Unix case coil. And what it does is that it creates an only it creates an even temperature throughout the throughout the house. So do you ever experience any hot and cold spots throughout the house? Yeah, the front room above the garage. Even though even though there's a lot of pretty much in the between the garage and the room. They put an installation right? Even I bring some ready to take it out. They take the temperature from the main floor and they only have one or two degree different, but they say that there's a reason of all and they can't do nothing much about it. But I feel pretty cold in the front though. I know that the furnace novel thing over I have no idea. Well, yeah, so when you do have never heat pumps installed because because of the way this coil works, you're going to have an even temperature throughout the house. What we also include to is a smart thermostat completely free will set up for you. So you this way you can always maintain complete control of the temperature. So when you set your. The time was started but I have right now is the next dinner for generations, right? Okay. Well, yeah, you are. Are you ready to do that or? Yeah, so we would honestly we would include the newest generation of nest completely free. That's a brand we use for that. If you already have the newest generation, then we'll just set up that that current nest that you have to our system. It's not going to be any problem whatsoever on that. So if you want to keep that thermostat the way it is, then we'll just we'll do it that way. I just install it was just connected to yours. So included in this package is we have a 10 year parts warranty, a one year labor warranty. So anything ever happened, anything breakdown will replace it for free. And what I find very unique about this is we also have a 24 seven emergency service. So if you called us at four o'clock in the morning saying, hey, my heat pump broke down, we will come the next few hours. We'll we'll we'll show up at your door at 8 a.m. and we'll fix it for you. Okay, so if this is something I like to ask everyone, if a heat pump was able to pay for itself, remain within budget and also leave you cash flow positive every month. Would you consider that to be a good opportunity? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, okay. So as I mentioned earlier about like average people's homes and utilities. So now I'm going to be more directed towards you. Your offset savings every month from having a heat pump installed. It's going to be $128. 528 is going straight to your pocket. We have a financing option of $61 a month at 7.99 at 7.99 interest rate. And if you wanted to just not do financing, you want to pay upfront, which is totally fine. $26,271.50. That includes taxes, deposit, installation, warranties, everything. But you saying the end bridge will up to 5000, they're going to rebate it, right? Yes, exactly. And we will help you with that whole rebate application, that whole rebate process. You say up to, but what's the minimum? What do they have to do? What's the make to get full rebate? So yeah, the, okay, so for a heat pump, they will give you $5,000. When I say up to, the rebate is for things like attic installation or the smart thermostat. Let's say you just wanted to upgrade your thermostat from a smart thermostat. The government will just give you $50. If you did like attic installation, then they'll give you a thousand. But since you're doing a heat pump, they're going to give you the maximum, which is $5,000. And we will make sure that you get the maximum possible from the government. Oh, if they're giving a multi or other NGA assistance stuff, they're giving the maximum everything. If you only want to do the key pump, you can get $5,000 on that key pump itself. Yeah, you will get, you will get $5,000 from the heat pump, for sure. Oh, so yeah, if we, if we were to, you know, do the math and, you know, include that $5,000 rebate when it comes out of pocket, it's going to be $12,71. So just a little over a thousand to do an energy efficient upgrade that's going to pay for itself and leave you with savings every month. But this rebate, how long would take? So the rebate process, the whole application process will take about four to six weeks. And then once that process is completed, it should take another four weeks to do it. They're going to be a lot better at, they've learned their lesson from last year and they're going to be a lot faster and a lot better with, with their process. They're going to, especially since we're doing this now, before the rebate actually comes out, it's actually going to be even faster than that since we're going to be one of the first people who puts the application in. But now they have to do the order to find out if I'm qualified or not, right? Yes, exactly. So when you do the audit, if the auditor comes back and he says, hey, this doesn't make sense. You don't even need to do it. You're not qualified for it. We will void the agreement on our behalf and we will send you your deposit back your $500 deposit will send it right back and then we'll part ways and, and that will be all. We're not, we're not here to be sharks or anything like that. We want to make sure that when you do this upgrade that you actually need to do this upgrade. We're not going to lock you into anything that you don't want to be in. If this is, yeah, I'm qualified, then you guys going to start to do it, right? Yeah, exactly. If you want to get the finance, you want to go up front and get the rebate. Yeah, exactly. Up front everything then I in within one or two months, I'll get all the rebate money from the government, right? Absolutely. Yeah. So we also have a problem. Who's really a rebate? Is it in bridge of the government? It's through the government, but it's only for an average client. You're an average client, right? Yeah, I got an average is a company, but yeah, they're not this other stuff. I have in the company for the water heater. Water heater tank is another company. Okay. But the gap is in bridge. Okay, I see. Okay, so I made this off that graph, which you can check out in the presentation if you want to as well. So every year everyone's bill is going to be increasing. Your neighbor's beastles are going to be increasing every year. When you have a heat pump, the only thing that's going to be increasing for you is going to be your savings. So right now your monthly savings will be at $128. At the end of the 15 years, you would have saved $21,477. So when you factor in the $6,000 that you that you're spending on the heat pump, you're going to get $15,000 back that would have just gone to Emberage anyways. You can use that $15,000 on an epic Japan vacation or whatever you want. Whereas all your neighbors are going to waste all that $15,000 on Emberage. So the total causes is $6,000, how much? And total everything? Okay, so on total everything, the cost for you is $6,271. But what I'm talking about is your savings that you're going to have. The savings after 15 years is going to be $21,477. Which when you factor in that $6,000 that you invest in the heat pump, you're going to have $15,000 that goes right back into your pocket. And you can use that for anything, right? That would just go straight to Emberage if you didn't do this. Okay, so we do. If you qualify, I will get the $5,000,000, right? Okay, so yeah, if you qualify, which I honestly based on everything I've seen so far, and the fact that you're on gas, your chances of being qualified are pretty much 99%. Like you're going to, I have a really strong feeling that you're going to get this rebate and no issues whatsoever. But, yeah, once the audit done, then I will know is everything qualified or not, right? Yeah, so yeah, you get a first audit and then they'll tell you if you qualify, they'll tell you right on the spot if you're qualified. If you're not qualified, we will avoid the agreement and send you your deposit back. If you are, then it's $300,300, is it $600,000, personally? So the total for the two audits is $750,000, and the government gives you back $600 out of those audits. So yeah, the audit... If you qualify, right? Yeah, exactly. If it's not, then you want to pay back $500. Yeah, so if you're not qualified, if you do the first audit and you're not qualified, we will give you back the money for the first audit. And then not do the second audit, so you will give you back around... Whatever $750 divided by two is... We will give you back that money. We like to do this as risk-free as possible for you. So send me a presentation, I'm going to take a look at what I was going to discuss with my wife. And I will... and I can get back to you, I guess. I already did send you the presentations to your email. Let me go through the full details with you. I want to make sure that you're fully informed before I send you off, okay? So we do offer two brands. The brand that I was talking about first is BladeX, which is a Canadian company. And honestly, they make more sense right now, but we do also offer a more premium brand called GRI. That one's going to be a more expensive thing. So honestly, I don't think it even makes sense. We're not going to go into detail about that. So the first one is BladeX, which is a Canadian manufacturer under the NDA brand. BLADX, like a nice blade. Okay, BladeX, okay. Okay. On the next one. The next one is called GRI, it's GRE. Those are the two brands we offer. Okay. So another thing we do just to add additional security if you want. We add a 10-year full protection plan at 9.50. And what this is is a 10-year parts warranty, 10-year labor warranty, and a third-party insurance warranty. Now, we've been doing well for about 15 years. But if anything ever happens to us, knock on wood. There will be a third-party insurance company that will keep the warranty going. So nothing will be... So we include everything with the full installation, including the wiring up to 20 feet. But we do ask all our clients to agree to a maximum $500 in additional costs. Honestly, 80% of people this doesn't happen to. But just in case it does, it's usually only extra wiring. And that's only with those really strangely built houses. I don't think that's going to happen. They're wiring from the electrical panels to outside again. Yeah, exactly. But honestly, with your house, I don't think that's going to happen. But we only just do this as a just in case, kind of deal. But then the wiring running to my A's, you guys don't use the same wiring, is it a bit different wire? Yeah, it's the same copper wiring, like electrical wiring. And if you want as well, we are able to take out that current AC unit you have, completely free. Yeah. Yeah. So just a little bit about why I choose us compared to other contractors, is one thing about this is that we have a best price policy. So we do a very huge volume with the manufacturers. So we can be any quote, any quote, apples to apples by at least 10%. We're not going to compete on just like $100 or $200. We'd rather just go 10% will beat you on that. We'll beat the other good guys on that. We offer free equipment replacements. And the great thing about us is that we're a lot more than just an H.I. company, is that we also help you when it comes to dealing with those government audits, doing those rebate programs, is that we're very experienced in doing these applications, rather than just you doing it yourself and risking getting declined. And we've done it so many times that we can almost guarantee that you'll get approved. So you can check us out on Google Reviews, a sit between 4.6 and 4.8. Like any business, we have made mistakes in the past, but we always solve them right away, and we offer full refunds when it's necessary. If you look on the reviews on those one-star reviews, a lot of them will say after, oh, edit, we've recontacted us, and they came before refunds, so I'm happy with them again. Like, that happens sometimes. And the only reason that happens is maybe sizing gets wrong or communication is misplaced, but yeah, so that's just a little bit of that. So here are some frequently asked questions that I get a lot when it comes to heat pumps. So how does a heat pump increase home value? Buyers are really looking at how energy efficient the house is before they purchase. So that house across the street, that's on $400 a month, gas furnace, is going to be worth a lot less than yours that is more energy efficient and on the heat pump. And yeah, how do I know I'm getting the best value with we rate home? We offer very unique solutions with multiple benefits and great warranties, a lot more than just the standard manufacturer warranties. As I mentioned, best price policy when comparing apples to apples, and if need be, we can also provide references. And is there any proof that a heat pump can save me on my energy bills? Yes, there is proof. You can see that on the Natural Resources Canada website. And what I will mention is that a heat pump is not a magic bomb. It's not a magic formula that saves you money. What it really does is it keeps the energy inside of the house for longer hours, which reduces your consumption. That's the main savings that happened. It's not from magic bark that just randomly does it. It's one that basically keeps your house more insulated. So will heat pumps be effective in very cool weather? Yes, we only use heat pumps that are built for Canadian weather. And we're using a heat pump increase my electricity usage. I will be transparent, is that it will increase it moderately. But these extra electricity costs will be significantly outweighed by the savings on your gas and oil costs. Heat pumps are very high efficiency, so they don't produce any waste whatsoever. And we also include an energy crusher that will reduce your electricity cost by up to 20% as well, so you're offsetting that even more. So at Weaver, we don't believe in creating any unnecessary risk for you, which is why we have a risk-free engagement policy. So our risk-free engagement policy is no surprise cause. So if a pond inspection is deemed necessary, the extra costs that are non-agreement must be incurred, then you reserve the rights to void the agreement and you receive your full deposit back. And yeah, as I mentioned on the flip side too, if the government auditor is like, hey, you don't need to do this, we will void the agreement on our behalf and send you the deposit back. We don't want you to take any unnecessary risk. We want to be problem-solver, it's not problem-cauthers, right? Yeah, so you have you heard of what a capacitor is? Capacitor, no, what's that? Okay, so a capacitor is pretty much a little box like it's installed right beside the panel. And when it does, it reduces the amount of power drawn by storing that electricity that would have otherwise been lost within the motor's year home. And it brings back that stored electricity back to your appliance, and it decreases the demand from your utility company. So on those on peak hours when the government is surging the electricity through the grid, you're not going to be drawing as much as everyone else is. So you're going to be end up saving on average 15%, but between 15% to 20% on savings on your electricity bill as well. So you're not only saving on your gas bills, but you're also saving on your electric bills too. So, you know, everything I've mentioned so far, by the way, what's your timeline for getting this installation done? I'll vote to let you know that after that. With anything as soon as I can do it, but I got the major, I'm going to go for it. I got the distance in my life and being at a semi-affirmative condition, all in that you know. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. All right, so I'm just going to go over briefly what the next steps are. Okay, so I'm going to send you a virtual agreement right now, to your email. And I do request that $500 deposit, and that's so we can start the rebate application and start doing that. And after that, I'll get back to you before I go to another thing. I'll get back to you. Okay, how about? Are you sending a presentation? I want to talk to my wife. Now I'll get back to you before we go further. Okay, can I follow up with you? Say tomorrow at 5 p.m.? Yeah, you know what? Call me Friday. Call me on Friday, but it's a me on presentation. I'll talk to my wife and I'll call me Friday evening. Friday evening? Yeah. How about Thursday? Do you have time on Thursday to talk around 5? I think no, I'm not going to have Thursday. Call me Friday. Friday, so 5.6 p.m. or 5 p.m.? Yeah, 5.6 is fine. Okay, all right, I'm going to call you on Friday at 5 p.m. I'll send you this presentation. And then, yeah, I'll also, before I call you on Friday at 5, I'm going to have the virtual agreements sent to your email. So that when we call on Friday, we can review it together. And that way, I can answer any questions that you have as soon as it come up. Okay. Okay. All right. So yeah, after that agreement is done, we both the audits and do the science section and installation. That whole process will just take a couple of weeks, okay? All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. I'll talk to you on Friday, all right? Thank you, but. All right.

That's how you put an inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump. Okay, yeah. I'm just calling to lay know about some updates in the market. The previous three-bay program, it has transitions and the government is now offering funds at a zero percent interest rate. Did you know about this before? So the government is offering what zero interest? Yeah, zero percent interest the fund and program, like they have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat bump and sell in your home at zero percent interest rate. Okay. Okay. Yeah, oh well, am I so worried because an appointment will occur, what I can do is I can schedule you for a talk with one of our advisors. She'll provide you with the exact price and the product that we offer. Okay. Okay. Do you just call me? Sorry, what? Isn't that while ago they were just offering like almost 15 grand, grand, 10 grand, something like that? There used to be a rebate program, yeah. The rebate program is ended on January this year, but for people who miss down on the rebate, government extended this interest-free program. We'll be able to pay out of our pocket. It is like if you, as I said, if you qualify, you will get the money from government, but that will be a zero percent interest. And you get this interest-free money for a period of ten years. You have ten years to pay back, and that's going to be interest-free. Yeah. The good thing with this program is you can qualify for up to $40,000. That's like a big range. You don't need to use all of that, but that's what you can qualify up to. If somebody is looking into different upgrades in their home, they can take advantage of it. Like giving up to it, I'm just behaving and cooling like that way, so. It can be like different upgrades like hidden and coolant or water heater, you know, somebody who want to upgrade their water tank. They can also take advantage of it or air sealant, you know, window caulking. There are certain upgrades that you can qualify for this program. Window caulking. Window caulking, air sealant. Okay. I'm not interested in this point, and I thought there was a program that was... But do you have like an in-bridge gap, or you like an in-bridge customer, or no? Yeah, I am. Oh, okay, good. Because there is something coming up for in-bridge clients only, but we don't know exactly when. What I can do is I can definitely save your name here at my end, and if anything comes back, or anything, any other program, and you rebate, I can lay you know. Okay. Sure, let me know. I do.

So this is hitting ventilation and air conditioning units but why did you do it as door to door sales? One is, is it allowed to do door to door sales? If yes, do we need to secure permits for it?

Yeah, we call it extra provincial license and we'll already operate that there. Okay. What's your business license number? I don't have, it's with me right now. Okay, cause usually it has the restrictions on it on how it's allowed, what's the dress that you operate out of? Yeah, okay. Just a second.

It's Weaver Eco Home INC. Eco Home INC? Yes. I'm not finding a business license under that name. So if you have a question about conducting business the best way to get that answer is submitting an inquiry on the business license contact us page at the same time. Yeah, actually my inquiry isn't about the license saying. It's just about details about what kind of business you'd be allowed to do so you would ask it to the business license office because they are the organization that is in charge of that. What's the number? It's not a number, it's online, so you'll submit an inquiry on our website. Contact the license office. Okay, again, I'm not inquiring for the license saying. That is who is responsible for what types of business is allowed to be conducted in the city and the rules around it. So if you would like the response to that you'll have to contact them. Okay. I can't give you that answer over the phone. I see. So I'm on your, I'm on a website and then. So I need to click contact us and then what's the email address?

I am on the page where I can see contact us. What's the page title at the very top? It's vancover.ca.

Yeah, we got a system put in on November 22. And there's been always been a problem. You know, it's supposed to save water and our water is like three times as much as we were used to using. And we do watching it and it's kept going every month, so I've never since you guys put your stuff in. So I need someone to come by and do whatever they have to do. We have the water filter and we have the water softener. And they're both hooked together. And when I use, now it's looked into it. When I use the bypass to go buy them, the water loss stops. So somewhere in the filtering and softening, there's water leaking out in big time and talking like it's costing like $5,000 over the last year for the extra water. So like, I really need this fixed. Okay, so sure no or is it all that it may have your name and address? My name is Paul Pasco, P-A-S-C-O-E. P-A-S-C-O-E. Okay, so and what's the full address? 4, 3, 2, 3, Beverly Crescent. And that is in Beamsville. Okay, so got it and the issue with the water softener, right? Water softer and water filter. We got them both. And ever since it's been hooked up with it, we're losing like 300% of our water. Okay, so some must be somewhat. There's nothing on the floor, there's no leaks, but there must be overflowing into the drain and that. Because it's just when I shut, when I bypass it with the valves at the top, the water loss goes away. So something to do with the in between those two pint tanks. Okay, so sure. I'm just making notes for a piece in everything. And I will just, I'm just going to open a service ticket for you. So the dispatch team will get back to you as soon as possible and they will assign a technician to come and fix the issue for you.

If you match it, then you should be all good with it. Plus, it has an application. Go ahead. What's the criteria? You should be the homeowner. The house should be your primary residence. Okay. It shouldn't be a new build because new build houses did not qualify. The house should be at least six months old. Okay. And it shouldn't be a condo or apartment because one thing in condos and apartments is not qualified. It has to be a house. Okay. And you should be a Canadian citizen or peer holder with a fair credit score. That's it. Okay. So what I can do is I can set up an online consultation with one of our advisors.

What's the house size and its car feet like roughly? It's about one level. Okay. And do you have a gas furnace in your home? We do. And how old is it? Probably around 10, 12 years old. Okay. Very good. This is your primary residence and you are the homeowner. Correct. That's correct. What's the average monthly electricity bill just a rough idea? Oh man, it's more because of the air conditioning. It's around 400 in the summer and closer to two 50 years ago in the winter months. Oh wow. That's a lot. Now what about your gas in bridge? Pardon me? Your gas bill, the in bridge bill? Just a rough idea. Monthly. Yeah, it's around 150, 200. Okay. All right. So now the email address, what I have here is a double check and it's your first name at marlinswindows.com. Is that correct? That's correct.

My name is Gina and I have a company name is Weaver Eka Home I&C and I can give you the hot number. My question revolves around here. It's eight. I don't know what account number you're talking about but I can't use it for anything. You can provide it to me if you'd like though. Okay, so my question is we have this certificate of registration, Business Corporation Act and I just want to ask if if we do a door to door sales, is this activity that we can do under this license? Sorry, is that a municipal business license you're asking about? Okay, so we have, I am not sure with what to answer you with that question. We have this extra provincial license so we are planning to do door to door sales in probably Vancouver so using this license are we allowed to do this activity? I don't know, who did you get that license from? We got this license from, we see registry services. Okay, yeah, I don't know about any licensing through BC registry services. You said that's for an incorporation, is that right? Yeah. Yeah, so do you want to talk to the incorporation department of BC registries as you've been out you're talking about? Yes, please. Is it just trust for the school? Okay, look up their contact information. It's like in transfer you through to the incorporation department of BC registries. Do you want the contact information for the incorporation department of BC registries before I transfer you to them? Okay, yes, please. So basically I just want to have, let me go when you're ready. Okay, basically I just want to be transferred to someone who could answer me this question. I'm not sure where to go, that's why I call this number. So basically that's the question that I am seeking for an answer. Right, and I'm trying to transfer you to someone so you can discuss that with them, but you've noted that you want to take down their phone number before I transfer you. So I'm ready now. I'm ready now. You don't let me know when you're ready to write that down. I'm ready now, please tell me. Okay, the BC registries phone number is 1, 877, 526, 1526, and then to get to the incorporation department through their phone menu, you would have to use option 1 and then option 2. And I can transfer you through to them now if you like. Yes, please, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you for calling service BC and please. So your call will be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Your call is important to us. Please hold for the next available agent. Thank you. Good afternoon, thank you, Columbia. You see registries? Hi, I'm a Grav to know. Yeah, my name is Regina and I'm calling from the company called Weaver, It Go Home. So we have a certificate of registration and we got this from BC registries services. And I just want to ask one question. So we would like to, we want to do a business in, I think in Vancouver. And that business is HVAC and we want to do door to door sales. So my question is, are we allowed to do this activity under this license certificate of registration? So sorry, you have a certificate of registration from BC registries? Yes, I can provide you with number. I just see I have here this number. Yeah, I can take a quick look back to start with an A. Yeah, it's A0127909. So what I was pulling up for me, I've got Weaver, It Go Home, Inc. Is that correct? Yes, that is correct. Perfect, okay, yeah, so that's an extra financial company that's registered here in BC. Yeah, in terms of what you are allowed to do specific to your business, we would not be able to answer that for you. We're just a record keeper here. We don't have any kind of legal expertise and we can't give any particular advice in regards to a specific business. So if you do have any questions about business activities or anything related to your specific business, there's a resource in BC that's called Small Business BC. Yeah, you could reach out to. I just actually called them earlier, two hours ago and they referred me to like C.D. O. Vancouver and then C.D. O. Vancouver, four wide me to you guys. So they are the one I called first. Yeah, so there, unfortunately, if you didn't have luck with them, it is a matter of getting some independent to business advice. We just don't have the expertise here, we're just a record keeper. So we can't unfortunately provide any guidance on your specific business activities. Okay. Okay, you said Small Business BC, right? Just want to make sure we're doing the same place, correct? You're referring to Small Business BC. Yeah, but the number, small business BC is the number I have for them is 164, 775, 5525. Can you repeat that again, please? Yeah, of course, 164, 775, 5525. Okay, I think I called the fact that I'm a bit earlier. The CRB industry, if you did call them and they referred you to the city of Vancouver, it's probably because you mentioned the license, which is then at the municipal level. So that's probably why they sent you over to like the city of Vancouver. Is there the ones who deal with the actual license? Okay, okay, okay, thank you so much. I'll call them again. Okay. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye. All right. That's the next thing.

20240521-154519_2207_+14165754993_Outgoing_Auto_2197633673043.mp3," Hi Tom, this is Huston Kullen from Weaver, Ika Hulm. As are you putting inquiry on our Facebook ad for a heat bump? Yeah, how does it work? You tell me. Yeah, the heat bump is the dark goes cool and hidden. It works both like an AC as well as a furnace. It runs with a technology called as thermodynamics, which means that... I have a furnace inside. Yeah, the good thing is Tom, the heat bump is connected to the furnace, so you don't need to remove your furnace. You actually always need to have a furnace with a heat bump. A heat bump has an outdoor unit that's going to be outside your home, and an indoor unit which is a coil and it gets connected to the furnace. And through the dark work, it's going to provide you with heat and an cool end. You use the heat bump until it's kind of like minus 25 Celsius outside, and when it goes beyond that, the heat bump is going to turn off and the furnace is going to take in. So you use the furnace only at the back up, not all the time. You see? What I mean? Do I have the rebate from the government? No, Tom, there used to be a rebate program which actually ended on January this year. However, for homeowners who missed out on the rebate, government has expanded a limited time interest-free funding program. They have a specific criteria. If you qualify, government will give you the money to get a heat bump installed in your home at 0% interest rate, and you get this interest-free money for a period of 10 years. Oh, it's pretty flexible. If you pay the pump, I have to pay the pump myself, but they don't trust interest. No, they don't charge interest, and they give you the money to pay for the heat bump. Or the pay for it. Yeah, they pay for it, but it's going to be a 0% interest. So you've got to pay back the government, but it's going to be a long period like 10 years. Now, basically, when you get a heat bump in the first five years, the savings that you're going to make with the heat bump is going to pay back for itself. So that's how it's going to put you on a positive cash flow. 10 years, we have to pay back the 10,000. Like, it's whatever is the product, like print sample. How much is this heat bump cost? Now, it actually ranges anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000. That's the range. Now, whenever is the price, for example, if it's going to cost you $5,000, the government is going to give you that $5,000 to get a heat bump in your home, and it's going to be a 0% interest. So you've got to pay back the $5,000 over a period of 10 years, and it's going to be interest free. Okay? I see that the heat pump is only $2,000, and the water is just $3,000. Why are you so expensive? More money than their fullness? I'm actually not sure. That's the range I gave you. It ranges from $4,000 to $6,000. And it does both coolant and heat em. It works both like an AC as well as a furnace. And you qualify for interest free program as well. Okay. Now, what I can do as Tom, I myself work as an appointment booker. I can set up an online consultation with one of her advisors. She will discuss the details of this program with you and go through numbers as well. And if you like it, you can go ahead. And also the install is not free, right? Oh, it's basically everything included. Like the range I gave you, it includes the installation as well. It is, isn't it? Yeah. Plus the warranty. We kind of do have a discount going on, which you can definitely take advantage of. Okay. I have already all furnace. You have a very old furnace? Like how old? 20 years. Okay. Is it like working good or it's broke or what? Do you have any complaints with it or no? No complaints. So the thing is, Tom, as I said, you're going to be using your furnace only as a backup for emergency. Only when it's like extremely cold out. Let me see where do you live. Are you like in GTA or where? I have a none of top three. This furnace is only about four years old. The furnace. Okay. It's carrier. Okay. Is that your primary residence or no? Yeah. Okay. The thing is for this program, they have a specific criteria, one of which is you should be the house should be your primary residence. So you can only look into the house that you live in. Okay. All right. So tell me a bit about your home like when was your house built? I don't know. Can you, if I in the middle of doing something, can you call me out for about half hour? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. Why not? Sure.",342.8698866213152,-7.354438275797293e-05,0.8836945295333862,-0.9681928157806396,0.07063102722167969,184.7652154195011,0.1420641025641026,0.4872054057054057

That is where you get information on obtaining a business license for the city of Vancouver. They will want to know what you are doing. Okay. Are you saying that this license is not sufficient for us to carry out this activity? The one that you have now? Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't give you the right to do anything really. It just establishes the corporation and the province. Okay. Is it the same as the registered or companies? Does not know what you do. They have no way of knowing what you do. Okay. So what is it for if I make this ask what we have then? That is the legal entity. So that is like registering the legal entity in the province. So it is required by the province. So you establish the entity but they don't necessarily know what you are doing. It is a corporation. It is establishing the corporation in the province. Okay. It is required. Legally it is required under the BC Business Corporations Act. Yeah. All the corporations have to be registered in the province that are doing business in the province. Now also to make a little more confusing. Is it? You have a lot of work up here now. All right. If you open up another browser or another tab on your computer. Okay. And go to www. Okay. Dot consumer protection BC. Got it. So we know. Consumer. Consumer protection. Dot c. Dot c. That c. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This also this business has rules around door to door sales. So that is what you are doing as well. But this is center for, I think this page is only for consumers, not really for entrepreneur. They regulate certain business activities as well. Yeah. And they do. There's a regulation. Yes, you write the protects consumers. But so the consumers have certain rights when they purchase things from door to door sales and that you should just be aware of. I see. Like they can, I think your, this consumer is allowed to get a refund or something. There's so many days or something like that afterwards or something like that. Okay. I'm just surprised that the license that we have is just equivalent to nothing. That's not a license you have. It's a registration. Right? Like the different, if you think of it differently as this, maybe the different governments, right? So you've registered your corporation with the province of BC. And it's established it in the province of BC at a certain address. But there's also the cities, just a different government. They give you the right to conduct business within their city. Right. So the city of Vancouver, every city, every business in the city of Vancouver has to have a license in the city. They have to pay them a fee and then the city gives them, quote, the right to conduct business at a certain address. I see. All right. Do you have any contact details of like a legal that I can approach with, you know, just to assist us in securing this licensing stuff? We refer a lot of people to a local law firm that is called Benchmark Law. That's the same thing for a lawyer. No, no, okay. Not really a law firm because they're quite expensive. So it's so, you know, like an entity that just assists in local entity that assists people from other provinces or businesses from other provinces to acquire license in say Vancouver, not really a law firm because they're quite expensive. Yeah, there's not, there's not like a, that I know of an organization that will help us through it. Like we're an organization that provides information and tells you where to go and do things, but we don't do anything actually. Yeah. I understand. Half, yeah. Okay. And it's a little more difficult for you too because if you're doing door-to-door sales, then there's lots of cities in the lower mainland, for example. Right? Like even if you're in Vancouver, you cross the street and you're in Bernabé, different city, different rules, different licenses that you're required. Say Bernabé is- Oh, complicated. We need to secure even though we cross like 10 kilometers away from Vancouver. Do we need to secure another- Yeah, like Kenjiit across the street here in a different city. Right? There's a lot of different independent cities in the lower mainland. Like there's even Vancouver as a city. West Vancouver is another city. North Vancouver is another city. Three cities, all different. And then there's a district in North Vancouver, but depends on, and then you have Bernabé Richmond's, newest minister, Syri, Delta, they're all different cities. Yeah, I understand. So, another question, you might or you might not know about it. So, is Dr. Gore sales allowed this day in Vancouver? You know, Dr. Gore sales. Each of us, Dr. Gore sales, yeah. As long as we have that permit. As long as you have that permit, like I don't know that they're not allowed. But yeah, the city that gives you that final say. Sorry, I'm just comparing it from Ontario. That's why my tone is like that Ontario is not allowed. So, but- It's not. Is it? No, it's not. And I'm not, I don't, I can't give you a definitive answer because I'm not 100% sure, but I'm just trying to think of, I don't know, I live in a parliament. So, I don't see door to door salesmen at all. But, um, you all would take as a phone call to the city, and they'll let you know right in the phone. If they allow a license for that. Right? Yeah. Yeah, probably. But then, but then, but then yeah, you have to call another city, like, Burnaby is possible. They could say, no, it's not allowed in Burnaby, but it might be allowed in Vancouver. Um, it's true. It's complicated. It is. I have a phone number for the city if you want to give them a call. Yeah, can you provide me please? Sure, sure. It's out from, it's 6.04. 8.73. Okay. 7,000. 7,000. Okay. That's city Vancouver. You don't have an, okay. So I just need to go to the licensing department, I believe. Yeah, they just generally have a general, everyone sort of answers the questions at the first heart. They'll just hopefully be able to answer that, definitely if they allow. Um, door to door salesmen, they may, sometimes they do just tell people, fill out a business license and send it to us, business license application instead of to us. And it's a city Vancouver's also notoriously a little slow. Today, you'll, you'll send them a business license application, they will get back here in four to six weeks. Oh, four to six weeks. Yeah, that's why they phone them first and maybe ask them what their turn around time is currently on business license applications or see if they'll let you know if it's even on something that's they allow. I would think they do, but yeah, they'd, they'd hopefully confirm it for you. Okay. Okay. Okay. I understand. Okay. Thank you so much. And what is your name? My name's Gary. Gary. Yeah. Thanks so much. Gary. Yeah. All right. All right. Okay. All right. Okay. Good luck. All right. Bye. Bye.

So if you get approved for this financial company for us, and we do the application for the government, and you get approved for the government loan, the approval is going to be the monthly payments for you. At the end is going to be here. Have it. You want to check. You want to check them. The monthly payment is supposed to be 190, but the 10-year loan is an open term. So which means that I'm pretty sure not only can you pay a monthly, you can also pay whenever you have up to 10 years to pay it off. Which means that if you pay 190 every month, you can have it paid off by 10 years, but because it's an open term, if you choose to pay it either, you know, pay it more, you can pay it quicker, or if you want to like just way a little bit to start paying it, I'm pretty sure you could do that as well. Okay, for 10 years, 190. Because it's 0%. 190 per month for 10 years, right? Yes. So what they are giving me, yeah, is monthly payment 38 for 60 months. The one that I send you for, the form that I send you for is no payments, and no interest for six months. Which means that would be after the six months, if you decide to go with, if you decide to stay paying this, but you're not going to do that because what you're going to do, if you get approved for the government loan, is use that loan to pay this off, and then just stay paying the government. If once we did the application, let's say for some reason, you do not get approved by the government, we will cancel the whole thing, and you don't have to worry about going forward with this one. Okay, okay. That's all it is. What is the total purchase price, the goods? The total for everything with the outed and everything all together, is after taxes. Uh-huh. You're looking at... You're looking at 22,770. Okay, what I have here is 32,269. Yes, that one is because 2269. That's because we take off the $500 deposit. Okay. Because that one, you know, if we can get you approved for this, we will take the $500 deposit, and we take it off the whole total. Okay. You know what, from what I'm seeing, this 60 months seeing? Yeah. Looks like I like it. If I... I also hope the government will approve it, if not, I might seek keeping it. I don't know. It does, I have too many of that things to do. If this one gets approved, there is a high chance that the government one gets approved. That's why in your... That's why in your... what is the call? That's why in the agreement I added that if this one, for example, if the government one does not get approved, we will avoid the whole thing and you don't have to go forward with this one, okay? Okay, then, okay. Yes, we don't do that stuff anymore, but in your case, because you mentioned that you don't want to do any financial anymore loans in your part, I added, we decided to do that just to make sure that you will get it installed once you... We know for sure that you've got to approve for the government. Okay, then, okay. All right, yeah, thank you. Perfect, so just make sure that you add your income plus the rental. Once you've finished that up, let me know if... Give me a call, I can double check on my end as well, but just in case if I'm in a meeting, give me an update if it changes the status, and if it didn't, my team will contact them as well just to make sure. Okay, okay, all right, yeah. Perfect, Grace, let me know.
